# Building Furniture

## Chair Text and Image Directions
### Materials Required
- 1/8-in. x 24-in. x 48-in. Hardboard (for templates)
- 1x6 x 8 ft. cedar boards (2)
- 2-in. galvanized screws
- 2x6 x 8 ft. cedar boards (2)
- Thompson's Water Seal finish (1 pint)
- Wood glue
### Directions for Assembly
Make template
- Mark one-inch increments on both ends and one side of the hardboard.
- Draw grid lines using a combination square, straight edge and fine-point permanent marker.
- Transfer the points to your hardboard grid where the shape intersects the grid lines in the drawing.
- Draw lines connecting the points made on the grid.
- Use a smooth, arcing arm movement to draw the gradual curve.
- Use a quarter to trace the 1/2-in. radiuses at the bottom of the leg.
- Use a jigsaw to cut out the pattern.
- Align the backrest strut template to the centerline and bottom edge of the cedar piece and trace the shape.
- Flip the template along the centerline to draw the other half.
- Cut out the pieces with a jigsaw.

Use template
- Align it to centerlines drawn on the boards, trace around it, then flip it over the centerline and trace the rest of the shape.
- Sand the edges of the curved pieces with a belt sander.
- Cut all the pieces to the dimensions given in the Cutting List, using the templates for the legs and the top slat.
- Cut out the shapes with a jigsaw.
- Sand the pieces with a belt sander. 

Drill the Ends 
- Drill the ends of the hand grip holes with a 1-in. spade bit.
- Lay out the hand grip hole in the top slat, then cut it out using a jigsaw and spade bit.
- Rip the back and seat slats two inches wide using a table saw.
- Lay out, countersink and drill all the screw holes for the slats and supports.
- Sand all the pieces with 120-grit, then 150-grit sandpaper.
- Round over the sharp edges with the sandpaper. 

Align the Seat 
- Use a carpenter's square to align the seat supports 90 degrees to the backrest struts, then glue and screw them in place.
- Use glue and screws to attach the slats, too.
- Screw the two seat supports (D) and curved top slat to the backrest struts using the spacing given in Fig. A.
- Attach the five slats to the backrest struts and six slats to the seat struts.
- Attach the Slats 
- Attach the slats to the seat struts using a 1/2-in. spacer to align them.
- Finish driving the screws by hand to avoid setting their heads too deep. 

Finishing Touches 
- Before applying the finish, unscrew the two seat supports and apply weather-resistant glue (like Titebond II or Gorilla Glue) to the joints, then re-screw the seat supports to the backrest struts.
- Brush on two liberal coats of a penetrating exterior wood sealer (like Thompson's Water Seal).
- Let the first coat dry for 24 hours, then apply the second coat.
- After an hour, wipe off any excess finish.
- Let the finish dry for a couple of days before using the chair.

## Bench Text and Image Directions
### Materials Required
- 2x4 x 8’ cedar
- 5.4x6 x 10 cedar decking (2)
- 1x6 x 6’ cedar (4)
- No. 20 biscuits (12)
- 2-1/2” deck screws
- 1-5/8” deck screws
- Wood glue
- ½” flattop wood plugs (40)
- Exterior wood finish
### Directions for Assembly
Cut out and drill the parts 
- Use a 1/2-in. Forstner bit to drill recesses for the screws.
- Cut the biscuit slots for the seat rails: Mark the centers of the biscuit slots on masking tape. Then, with the plug recesses facing up, cut the slots in the narrow sides of the legs. Keep the plate joiner and leg tight to the bench top as you cut. Use tape to avoid marks on the wood and to keep track of the orientation of the pieces.
- Position slots for the long rails with a spacer: Orient the leg so the previously cut slot is facing up, and cut a slot on the side opposite the plug holes. Use a spacer to position the slot so the long rail will be centered on the leg when it’s installed.
- Cut slots in the rail ends: Mark the centers of the curved seat rails and long rails on masking tape.
- Cut slots in the long rails: Position the long rails with the masking tape facing down. Use a Speed Square as a guide for cutting biscuit slots for the intermediate rails. Align the square with the edge mark for the seat rail. Make a center mark on the square as a reference for lining up the plate joiner. 

Join the rails and legs with biscuits 
- Put a biscuit in the slot and dry-fit the leg and seat rail to make sure the rail is oriented correctly. It should be centered on the leg. Then spread glue in the slots and on the biscuit and press the leg and the seat rail together. 
Complete the leg assembly and seat assemblies
- Use a spacer to support the lower rail. Then drive screws through the legs into the rail.
- Connect the seat rails with biscuits Join the two long rails with the two intermediate seat rails with biscuits and glue. Clamp them and let the glue set about 30 minutes.
- Connect the leg assembies to the seat assembly with biscuits and clamp them together. Then attach the brace with screws.
- SCREW ON THE SEAT SLATS Start by attaching the two outside slats. Then center the middle slat and attach it with screws. Next, position the remaining slats so there’s an even space (two biscuits wide) between them. Use a board to align the slat ends 

Finishing Touches 
- HIDE THE SCREWS WITH WOOD PLUGS Glue flat-top wood plugs into the plug recesses. Use a cutoff dowel or a small block of wood to pound them flush.
- Finished the bench with Cabot Australian Timber Oil.

## Building Furniture Round 1 Peer Review
As a team, answer the following questions about another team’s Chair or Bench directions 

1. Check for some basics: 

________Is each figure labeled? 

________Do the text directions refer to each figure? 

________Are the figures and text interspersed (not all the images are at the bottom or top of the page)? 

2. Now, look for more nuanced choices and explain your reaction: 

- How did the team put the directions in order? Are they numbered or do they use page spacing or other ways to show the order? How are they different from your order?
- How closely do the spirit of the images that your or the other team created match those of the official directions? (No weighing in on artistic ability.) What are the main differences? Why do you think those differences exist?
- How closely do the text directions that your or the other team created match those of the official directions? What are the main differences? Why do you think those differences exist?
- What other major differences exist between your two sets of directions? If you were going to create one document from your two, what choices would you make to include some of each of your work (without defaulting to the official directions)? Why?
- What other things do you notice about the two sets of directions? 

3. Both teams should get together to share their findings. After sharing your peer review, make another set of directions using the new text and the new images that you think is the best version of the directions, using aspects from both teams’ work and trying to avoid using the “official” images and text as much as possible.

## Building Furniture Round 2 Peer Review
Now you will look at the other project and offer peer review in teams. If you worked on Bench, you will match with a Chair team (and vice versa). As you look at the Bench or Chair directions created by the team, answer the following questions. 

1. Check for some basics: 

________Is each figure labeled? 

________Do the text directions refer to each figure? 

________Are the figures and text interspersed (not all the images are at the bottom or top of the page)? 

2. For this set of questions, get some craft paper, foam core, cardboard, or other material and try to make the piece of furniture in ¼” scale to the best of your ability. Feel free to use tape or other easily accessible supplies to connect the parts to one another.  

- As you build the model, note where you had trouble with the directions here. (Be as specific as possible.)
- What images did you find helped you the most? Which ones helped you the least? Explain why.
- Based on your experience trying to follow these directions, suggest changes to the order, working, layout, images, or other aspects here.  

3. Share your finding with the team that authored these directions.  

4. What has this experience taught you about writing directions?
