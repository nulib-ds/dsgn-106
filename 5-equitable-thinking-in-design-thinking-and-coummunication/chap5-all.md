# Equitable Thinking in Design Thinking and Communication
**Assignments for What is Design Thinking and Communication and What Does it Have to do with Equity?**

by Dr.Â Laura Pigozzi

## Possible reflection topics

-   Identifying and addressing assumptions

-   Planning and conducting new research (primary & secondary)

    -   Answer new questions

    -   Explore benchmarks and analogies

-   Identify underlying beliefs, values, motivations

    -   Data \> Insights \> Implications

    -   Implications = translate insights to the specific challenge at hand

-   Iteration -- new questions are solved in different ways

    -   Primary research

    -   Secondary research

    -   Prototyping

    -   Performance testing

    -   User, stakeholder, and expert feedback

-   Bias -- how to minimize

    -   Secondary research related to initial insights

    -   Primary research should include experts and stakeholder

## A.  **Assumptions and Research**

In the reading, the authors mention the existence of assumptions within the design process, and give an example of how underlying assumptions might impact a design for helping people access healthy foods. This example demonstrates the importance in design to conduct appropriate research to minimize the impact of assumptions and biases.

If you were part of a design team working to improve access to healthy foods for a specific community, what research activities might you include to increase your understanding of the challenges and context?

-   List two topics you could explore through secondary research, and two people or organizations (aside from the users themselves) who you might contact for primary research.

-   Briefly describe what you would hope to learn from each of these four research options.

## B.  **Research and Iteration**

> Articles and stories about design thinking often focus on the iterative nature of design, and the importance of connecting to end users. For example, both the IDEO video and the Chapter 7 reading discuss iteration as part of making prototypes and getting feedback from users, but iteration is used for other design activities, too, such as design research.
>
> Research is important at the beginning of the project, when you are trying to learn more about the challenge to be addressed and the user needs. It is just as important later in the project as you explore potential solutions. The process of prototyping and getting feedback typically leads to new questions. While some of these questions can be addressed with another round of prototyping, some require conducting additional secondary research, or primary research with people other than the end users.
>
> Imagine that you are part of the team mentioned in Chapter 7 that is designing a way to encourage kids to be more physically active, and you generated some solution ideas for new afterschool programs, for programs that connect new friends through adventure activities, and for gamified apps that pose ongoing exercise challenges. While you would clearly connect with kids, teachers and parents, what secondary research should you conduct?

-   List at least three different secondary research topics you could explore

-   For each one, write a sentence or two to describe how it would help you better understand the potential challenges or effectiveness of the solution ideas.

## C.  **Assumptions and Scope Change**

Both the Chapter 7 reading and the article, *How an Improved Food Service Creates a*

*Better Life Quality for Elderly People*, describe the need to change the scope of the project. This is common in design. Most design projects start with a problem statement that is founded on a number of assumptions. As the design team learns more about the challenge through primary and secondary research, they often discover that the underlying issues do not match those initial assumptions, leading to a need to adjust the problem statement or scope.

Re-read the portion of the Chapter 7 that discusses the design brief (three paragraphs, beginning with "In any design process, the design brief is key.") and the beginning of the article about the food service project, up through and including the inset box, "Design Challenge: Changing Scope."

-   List two underlying assumptions in the food service project.

Now consider your own project.

-   List two assumptions related to your project challenge.

-   Identify two primary and two secondary research activities that you could do to confirm or change these assumptions.
