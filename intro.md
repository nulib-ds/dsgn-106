# Design Thinking and Communication

Welcome to Northwestern University's Design Thinking and Communication OER website! Design Thinking and Communication (DTC) is a two-course sequence required of all first-year engineering students at Northwestern University. Housed across two schools: Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and McCormick School of Engineering, the course employs 45+ faculty to partner-teach 70+ sections per year with 1,000+ student enrollments. Each section is taught by a design instructor and a communication instructor.

The creation of OER materials for DTC was a two-year endeavor. In the summer of 2020, Lisa Del Torto and Alex Birdwell, the co-directors of Design Thinking and Communication, used an OER grant provided by Northwestern Libraries to hire several DTC faculty members to create OER materials. This effort was continued in the summer of 2021 by Alex Birdwell and Michele Zugnoni, who had taken over from Lisa as the Cook Family Writing Program's Director of Design Thinking and Communication. Alex and Michele obtained a second grant from Northwestern Libraries and used it to again hire faculty to create additional resources.

Once created, OER materials were then placed into the course interface system, at the time Canvas, for use by all DTC sections. By using OER materials and other faculty-crafted materials, DTC has been able to eliminate use of any materials students might otherwise pay for. As a result, money has been eliminated from the DTC social equation, adding to the equitability and inclusivity of the DTC student experience.

If you have any questions about these materials, please reach out to Michele Zugnoni at [michele.zugnoni@northwestern.edu](mailto:michele.zugnoni@northwestern.edu).
