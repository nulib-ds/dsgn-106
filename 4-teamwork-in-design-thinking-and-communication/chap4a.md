# Teamwork Reading and Activities

<big><i>Written by: Kiki Zissimopoulous, PhD and Michele Zugnoni, PhD</i></big>

## Overview
Dr. Kiki Zissimopoulos and Dr. Michele Zugnoni have written a chapter on teamwork which guides students through an approach to teamwork that emphasizes collaboration and working from a growth mindset. The accompanying videos focus on handling conflicts and communication in teams, and contain interviews from students who graduated from the Design Thinking and Communication course at Northwestern University, where they worked together in teams throughout the quarter. Other materials include constructive/destructive behaviors, scenarios, and reflections, all of which help students conceptualize how to effectively work in teams, and apply their knowledge to course-based teamwork.
