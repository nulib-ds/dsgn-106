# Constructive and Destructive Behavior Ice Breaker

<big>_Written By: Kiki Zissimopoulos, PhD_</big>

> ### BACKGROUND INFORMATION
>
> This activity is useful as an icebreaker and will work best in the first or second week of the quarter. It allows students to discuss their team behaviors in a neutral environment before any team interactions occur in DTC. The goal of this activity is for students to have an open, honest discussion on past teamwork experiences, and to self-reflect on their own teamwork tendencies. This self-disclosure will make discussions that may arise later in the quarter easier to initiate. This icebreaker will also fast-track the team's process in getting to know each other and help the team start to develop empathy for each other. It is important to note that while these behaviors are divided into two polarities to facilitate discussion, they probably operate on a continuum in reality.

### Prompt for conducting activity

_Activity Adapted from Brunt (1993). "Facilitation Skills for Quality Improvement." Quality Enhancement Strategies. 1008 Fish Hatchery Road. Madison WI 53715._

We all may exhibit both productive and less productive behaviors on teams. Under stress, our less helpful behaviors might start to dominate, so an awareness of our behaviors can help maintain positive team dynamics throughout the project. In reading through the Behavior Description list below, identify your single most constructive group behavior and your single most destructive group behavior.

### Instructor decides next Steps. <br>Possible options for implementation:

1.  **Individual Reflection:** You may want each student to submit a reflection to you, the instructor.

    - _Reflection prompt:_ In a reflection to instructors, describe your constructive and destructive teamwork tendencies and the types of situations that trigger these behaviors. This exercise can be helpful for you to understand the team dynamics.

2.  **As Reference Material:** You may want to just provide this info as background material regarding different teamwork behaviors, as an FYI.

    - The instructor may choose to provide just the descriptions as reference material and explain to students that these are different behaviors and tendencies that teammates might exhibit on teams. Even just prompting students to read the descriptions and think about the different ways people act on a team can be helpful.

3.  **Individual Reflection + Discussion:** The instructor might assign an individual reflection that they submit only to you (i.e., #1 above) and then encourage students to self-disclose whatever they are comfortable sharing with their team. You may consider being present (virtually or otherwise) for this discussion so you can help facilitate.

    - _Reflection prompt:_ In a reflection to instructors, describe your constructive and destructive teamwork tendencies and the types of situations that trigger these behaviors. This exercise can be helpful for you to understand the team dynamics.

    - _Team assignment:_ In your first team meeting, share your behavior tendencies. By sharing with the members of your group, other teammates may draw upon constructive behavior and minimize destructive behavior as you work together.

### Behavior Descriptions

#### Constructive

- _Cooperating_: Is interested in the views and perspectives of other group members and willing to adapt for the good of the group.

- _Clarifying_: Makes issues clear for the group by listening, summarizing, and focusing discussions.

- _Inspiring_: Enlivens the group, encourages participation and progress.

- _Harmonizing_: Encourages group cohesion and collaboration. For example, uses humor as relief after a particularly difficult discussion.

- _Risk Taking_: Is willing to risk possible personal loss or embarrassment for the success of the overall group or project.

- _Process Checking_: Questions the group on process issues, such as agenda, time frames, discussion topics, decision methods, and use of information.

#### Destructive

- _Dominating_: Uses most of the meeting time to express personal views and opinions. Tries to take control by use of power, time, and so on.

- _Rushing_: Encourages the group to move on before the task is complete. Gets tired of listening to others and working with the group.

- _Withdrawing_: Removes self from discussions or decision making. Refuses to participate.

- _Discounting_: Disregards or minimizes group or individual ideas or suggestions. Severe discounting behavior includes insults, which are often in the form of jokes.

- _Digressing_: Rambles, tells stories, and takes the group away from primary purpose.

- _Blocking_: Impedes group progress by obstructing all ideas and suggestions ("That will never work because . . . ").
