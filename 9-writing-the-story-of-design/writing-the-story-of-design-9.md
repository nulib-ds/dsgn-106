# Writing the Story of Design
## **Project Objective and Overview**

Students need to write the background and introduction section of the final DTC report in a way that entices readers to care about the project. Unfortunately, most teams wait to write this section until the end of the quarter when they are exhausted from the work and rushing through it. Also, because instructors emphasize that the appendices and concept and rationale sections need to be written objectively, students fail to capture the human component of human-centered design in their background and introduction sections.

This set of writing assignments is meant to get students to capture in writing the empathy and excitement of the project earlier in the quarter. It is also an exercise in peer review, evaluation of team writing, and collaborative writing.

In part 1, each student writes or makes a video of what will be the background and introduction section of the report. These serve as individual first drafts. Instructors should encourage students to write this with as much exciting prose as possible, emulating a Kickstarter campaign or a movie trailer. Instructors assign this in Week 4 (and can do so as an individual writing assignment).

In part 2, students read or watch one another's part 1 drafts and have an in-person discussion about what they like about each one. The goal after that discussion is to write a collective version based on a synthesis of the individual versions. This will happen in class during week 8 and is a team assignment. By week 8, the students can write a collective background and introduction and then move straight into writing the design concept and rationale section collaboratively in this same session. This exercise should help students write collaboratively in real-time and break up their usual pattern of delegating certain report sections and appendices to individuals.

For both assignments, tell the students that this is not a narration of how they got to their design or how they went through the design process. It is the story of the design not the story of the design process they did as a team. The appendices already tell that story. At no point in the background and introduction nor in the concept and rationale section should the words "I," "we," or "then our team" appear. Also, remind them who the audience is for the report. Usually, they primarily identify the instructors, but the report is for the stakeholders. It helps students write with more clarity, detail, and compassion when they imagine the project partner and users reading the report.

## **The Story of the Design Part 1**

Although we have yet to talk about it in detail, you have been crafting parts of the final report for this term. It is easy to get bogged down in appendices and headings and IEEE, but the most important thing that the report does is TELL THE STORY of your design. This starts at the very beginning with the introduction and background of the design. You already know a lot about that, so you will draft this section now individually.

The **Background and Introduction** section of the report body should include:

-   What is the problem and why is it a problem

-   What exists as solutions

-   Users (who does it impact \[scenarios\])

-   Mission statement and requirements

Students often make this part so dry it is painful to read. Please do not do that. Your task for this first draft is to act like you are making a movie trailer. Start your draft with the words \"In a world\...\" and go from there. Perhaps watch some Kickstarter videos since the next step of this is to go from the problem (which you are stating here as the start of the movie trailer \[you know, the part with the serious music\]) to the solution (which will be your design! and maybe that will have inspirational music!) Please note, you are not ready to do the design/solution part of this, so take us right up to that part in this draft paper or video.

You are welcome to post this a video rather than a Google doc.

Every team member must submit this. In a later phase of the class, you will synthesize your versions of these.

## **The Story of the Design Part 2**

As a team, share your [\"The Story of the Design Part 1\"](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/149804/assignments/954171) with one another. In an in-person meeting, determine your favorite parts of each person\'s. Then, using as many of those favorite aspects or iterating on them to include their spirit, collaboratively write a new team draft of that assignment. Be sure it explains\--in an interesting way\-- the user and the problem. It can be as many paragraphs as you want, but it should be no fewer than 3. You now have the introduction and user and requirements section of your final report.

Once you have finished doing this, you need to write the next part\--the part where the cliffhanger of the background/intro of \"in a world\" pick up. You have us rooting for a solution, and we understand the stakes, so you now have to deliver! Please write the **Design Concept and Rationale** section here. Note that the first paragraph or two should give a thick description (measurements, movements, etc.) of the design, and there should be lots of images. The next part (which is the rationale) is to explain how you have addressed **each requirement** in your project definition. Remember not to make this boring\--you need to sell us on how brilliant this solution is!
