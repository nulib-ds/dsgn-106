# Ethics Lecture
# Learning Objectives

1.  Define *ethics* and *morality*

2.  Understand there exists theoretical ethics, professional ethics, and personal ethics

3.  Understand there are established professional codes of ethics

4.  Define and recognize *ethical dilemmas* and *ethical problems*

5.  Practice analyzing engineering ethic case studies

6.  Understand how ethics intersect with all areas of engineering and design

7.  Practice applying ethics to DTC project

# Ethics: Lecture 1

I.  10 minutes. *What is ethics?* Warmup question posed to students via Slido; they respond using phone/laptop and we project survey responses on screen.

II. 10 minutes. Brief Lecture: PowerPoint on Ethics

III. 15 minutes. 3 Case Studies: Divide auditorium into 3 sections (groups of 4 within sections) and assign each section 1 of the following cases:

-   "Unintended Effects"

-   "Time-Sharing Space"

-   "A Marshland's Fleeting Flourishing?"

> **Students will be asked to consider discussion questions (embedded in last slide of PowerPoint.)**

IV. 15 minutes. **Group Discussion** - Volunteers with mics take question from several groups.

# Ethics: Lecture 2

I.  5 minutes. **Ask:** "What kinds of issues come to mind when you hear 'ethics' and design?" Project student responses to screen and respond. (Use Slido.)

II. 5 minutes. **Individual Reflection:** Brainstorm on paper answers to the following:

> -What did you learn from Lecture 1 (Ethics) that you didn't already know?
>
> -What are 1-3 immediate thoughts you have when asked how 'ethics' is involved (or should be involved) in your design process?

III. 5 minutes. **Mini Lecture:** Review central points from Lecture 1

IV. 10 minutes. **In pairs:** Challenge yourself to think more about ethical issues, questions, or concerns with your design process.  Come up with 2-6 potential issues you hadn't previously considered. Base your discussion on the following areas:

> 1-Design process: how might ethics impact or guide your group dynamics as well as the design process?
>
> 2-Deliverables: what are challenges, questions, or concerns with the ethics of your design deliverables? Written deliverables?
>
> 3-Big picture: how do you see your group design fitting into a bigger picture re: ethics? Think history of ethical failures/successes in design as well as how ethical concerns might inform the physical output of your process...

V.  10 minutes. **Groups of 4:** Discuss what you came up with in pairs.  Ask questions, present ambiguities, and use your larger group to gain a clearer sense of how ethics impacts design at various levels.  As a group, formulate 1 question you'd like to pose to the whole gathered group and designate a speaker to pose the question with the mic.

VI. 15 minutes. **Group Discussion:** Come together to discuss as a large group (instructor with a mic will take questions from volunteer groups.)

# Ethics: Assessment Quiz for Canvas

1)  Though the terms are often used interchangeably, we stated distinct definitions for "Ethics" and "Morals"; give those definitions hea

2)  Identify the ethical problem in each case study. Describe it in a one-sentence problem statement.

3)  In no more than a paragraph, outline one potential solution responding to an ethical problem in your DTC project.

# Case Studies

Authors: Dr. Laura Pigozzi and Clara Mitchell

Source: <https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/more/engineering-ethics/engineering-ethics-cases/>

The following series of engineering ethics cases were created by interviewing numerous engineers from Silicon Valley and beyond.

The cases have been written, anonymized, and honed to highlight the ethical content from each interview. While these cases are meant for engineering students and professionals for their professional development, nearly all of the cases occur in the context of business, and therefore are also relevant for those seeking business ethics cases.

These cases are suitable as homework and/or for classroom discussion. The goal of this project is to acquaint engineering students and professionals with the variety of ethical experiences of engineering as practiced "in the field." By becoming familiar with problems faced by other engineers we hope to thereby prepare those reading these cases if they too encounter difficult ethical dilemmas in their work.

Cases range from the mundane to the deadly. While we do not reveal how each particular case turned out, in general they turned out well -- the people involved made the right decisions. But this is not to say that all of these right decisions came without personal cost. A few of the engineers did face negative repercussions and a very few even needed to find new employment. However, overall the interviewees were satisfied with how events turned out, even if they faced negative repercussions for their good decisions. They understood that doing the right thing is good in itself, regardless of the personal consequences they may have faced.

## Case 1

##### **Unintended Effects**

Jack has been working as a project engineer for a mechanical energy technology firm for a few years now, and has recently been promoted to review projects for in-need communities overseas. He has been put in charge of managing the current company's charity projects, and determining how to distribute the funding for them.

Some of the projects are pretty straightforward in their mission and material requirement, but for one project, Jack isn't sure whether the company should be funding it. The project's mission is to provide new solar panels for an East African community but the project data suggests it is more practical to just install better lighting inside the homes. Jack wonders whether to bring up his doubts with his boss. Based on the company's research on the community, the community desires better lighting system for their homes, and the solar panels would be an expensive and high maintenance project. Not to mention, there was a previous project that (when followed through) resulted in equipment being stolen from the same region to exchange for money.

Jack understands their local sponsor would gain a great advantage in featuring solar panels in the community. It would also foster a good business partnership between the two companies. However, Jack feels it is his responsibility to provide the community with a more simple and efficient solution to their problem, without diving into a large project that could possibly lead to negative side effects. Is Jack's company wrong to provide technology to the community when they don't need it?

## Case 2

##### **Time-Sharing Space**

Ramona is an intern at an up-and-coming power electronics startup. On her first day of work, she was shown around a laboratory where she would complete most of her projects. During this time, she was also introduced to nine male interns who would be sharing the same lab space. Since the lab could only accommodate five interns at a time, a vote was held to determine who would work in the lab during the day (e.g. 8am to 4pm) and who would work at night (e.g. 4pm to 12am) during certain days of the week. The morning shift was a popular option for a majority of the interns; Ramona was fortunate to be selected for four (out of five) morning shifts.

Weeks passed. Ramona had been enjoying her work and almost completed one of her projects. However, one day, a fellow intern asked how she was doing. Ramona commented that she was "good but tired." The intern replied that Ramona had "no reason to be tired because \[she was\] working mostly day shifts." Ramona was offended, but chose to ignore his comment.

The next day, she ran into several interns, one of whom was the one she encountered the previous day. At some point in group's conversation, the same intern made a remark about how Ramona "always got her way \[in the workplace\] because she was a girl." Ramona was upset; however, because she did not want to cause a scene, chose again to ignore his remark.

During the following weeks, Ramona tried to avoid the intern who made the inappropriate comments. However, certain settings forced her to interact with him and, in those times, he made a point to make Ramona feel guilty and trivial. Because she did not observe him behave condescendingly towards the other interns, Ramona speculated that her colleague held a prejudice towards female engineers.

How should Ramona respond?

## Case 3

##  **A Marshland's Fleeting Flourishing?**

Solomon is a principal engineer at an environmental engineering consulting firm. His main role is to advise clients on what type of action to take when they are faced with risks and liabilities while conducting certain projects.

In one case, Solomon had a client that wanted to expand their campus until it was within approximately 50 meters of a marshland. After construction of this extension, however, the client must ensure that a proper waste management plan is in place so that contamination will have minimal effect on the surrounding habitat.

The client came up with a solution that satisfied, but did not go beyond the bare minimum of state regulations. In other words, although Solomon's client prioritized a cost-effective plan, the environment would be subject to a certain percentage of contamination that would, within five to ten years, stifle the marshland's flourishing.

Should Solomon push for a more fiscally demanding, yet sustainable strategy\--at the risk of his client backing out of the partnership altogether?
