# Where to start

As the lines between digital and physical solutions become increasingly blurred, it is important that you feel confident exploring the best design solution, regardless of what form it takes. This guide is intended to provide practical suggestions for those looking for a place to start when exploring digital solutions.

There is no shortage of free tools, tutorials, and how-to guides publicly available, and the resources continue to proliferate and evolve. This guide is by no means comprehensive, and we encourage you to do your own exploration based on the needs of your design.

If you decide to create a digital solution, you will likely need to pursue additional guidance and practice via more advanced tutorials. Many of these are available on YouTube. Be sure to speak with experts or instructors to determine if this is optimal for your project.

# Is a digital solution right for your project?

You have conducted secondary research, gathered insights from interviews and observations, and just wrapped up an initial brainstorming session. You're now ready to pivot into exploring design solutions -- but how do you decide whether or not a digital or digital/physical hybrid solution might be needed?

To help you decide, consider places where digital solutions excel. For example, a digital solution might be suitable if your research uncovered requirements such as:

-   The ability to collect information from users

-   The ability to display to real-time information visually

-   The ability to share, comment, or collaborate virtually

-   The ability to take and share photos or videos

-   The ability to use geolocation to provide directions or information based on location

> One helpful hint is to consider whether or not a screen connected to the internet is an essential component of your design. This is a helpful rule of thumb in many but **not all** cases (e.g.
>
> Amazon Echo, Google Home all use voice commands without a screen).

# Types of wireframes (digital mock-ups)

If you answered yes to the considerations above, the next step is deciding how to get started with your design explorations. Digital mockups are often referred to as **wireframes**, and their fidelity (level of polish) evolves as you advance in the design process.

Typically, you will start out with low-fidelity wireframes which can be as simple as hand-drawn sketches. As you gather insights from users your designs will get more advanced -- ultimately incorporating visual aspects like color and imagery.

**Specifically for DTC students, coding and visual design experience is not required.** You can still explore digital solutions and create prototypes without any coding knowledge or visual design experience. The links and videos embedded in this document will help guide you through that process.

While you ideate and explore alternative solutions, you may need to decide if your design should be a website, an app, or even a hybrid physical and digital solution, often called a "connected product". When deciding between an app or a website, it's often best to default to a website due to their versatility and cost-effectiveness. But, an app is the way to go if you plan to include a feature that relies on the phone's hardware or operating system, like geolocation (Lyft, DoorDash), accelerometer (gaming), or camera and microphone (social / collaboration apps). It can also be beneficial to create an app when users will be frequently interacting with the solution in both online/offline mode or will benefit from contextual or location-based notifications and alerts (ex: news and weather push notifications).

# Tools for creating wireframes and prototypes

> The tools below are free and robust enough to support all levels of fidelity (low/mid/high). Many also offer the ability to link wireframe screens together to simulate an app or website flow without writing a single line of code - often called a clickable prototype.

## Figma \[[[www.figma.com]](http://www.figma.com/)\]

-   Preferred tool for many professional designers due to the easy-to-use features

-   Works in a browser (no app download needed)

-   Includes libraries of free templates and accelerators

-   Free to set up an account and get started right away (more advanced features are available on their Tier1 plan, which is [free to students](https://www.figma.com/education/) with a valid NU email address)

## Miro \[[[www.miro.com]](http://www.miro.com/)\]

-   Quick way to create wireframes using pre-built templates

-   Makes it easy to shift from brainstorming into mockups and collaborate as a team

-   Works in a browser (no app download needed)

-   Free to set up an account and get started right away (instructors also have free access -- speak with them if you would like to use MIRO)

## InVision \[[[www.invision.com]](http://www.invision.com/)\]

-   Easy option for creating a prototype using static images

-   Works in a browser (no app download needed)

-   Free to set up an account and get started right away

# Design resources for digital solutions

> There are many online resources available to help you incorporate usability best practices into your design. It's crucial to make sure your design is intuitive and can be comfortably used by as many people as possible. Here are a couple of places to start.

## Usability basics

-   Jakob Nielsen's Usability Heuristics: <https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/>

-   Accessible design for the web: <https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/>

## Design systems

> Many organizations have created their own "design system", which is essentially a library of different styles, colors, and components that help all of their digital solutions look and feel cohesive to end users. As you prepare your final design, you may want to draw inspiration from an existing design system -- many of which are free and publicly available.
