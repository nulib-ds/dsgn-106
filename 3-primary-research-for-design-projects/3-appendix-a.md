# Appendix A - Survey Planning Guide

<big>_Written by: Stacy Benjamin, Kaara Kallen, and Michele Zugnoni_</big>

To write and distribute your survey, first carefully read the information about surveys and sample populations in \[the DTC resource\].

## Set the groundwork

**Who are your target respondents?** Which of your various user groups and stakeholders is your survey aimed at? Be clear about who you have in mind so you succeed in collecting the information you need.

**What questions are you trying to answer?** Keeping specific goals in mind will help you write questions -- and answer choices -- that yield the information you need without getting intrusive or lengthy.

**How will you access your sample population?** Strive to reach beyond a convenience sample.

- Proactively seek to reduce implicit bias by seeking out user groups that are commonly underrepresented in research (while it varies by topic, this generally includes racial and ethnic minorities, women, and, for the type of research you are doing, non-students).

- Think about in advance and write with thought the text you will use to ask people to take part.

**What are you using to build your research instrument?** Google Forms (free) works great for the type of research you are doing. Other options are SurveyMonkey (free for brief surveys) and Qualtrics (you may have free access through your learning institution).

## Know how to write survey questions

Here are a few common types. For examples and more types, look at this [brief and readable resource](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/survey-question-types/) from SurveyMonkey.

- **Single-answer multiple choice**. Use for clear, relatively simple questions. This type of question is useful for filtering and sorting the data you collect. \[example\]

- **Multiple-answer multiple choice**. Respondents can choose more than one answer in a list.

- In both types of multiple choice, decide whether an "other" choice with a short-answer line is needed.

- **Ranking**. Respondents rank answer choices according to a specific factor, such as most to least frequent or most to least preferred. Make sure the word or phrase you choose to describe the factor is precise, clear, and can't easily be misinterpreted.

- **Rating**. Respondents rate answer choices on a scale, for example, 1 to 10. Make sure you define your scale, e.g., "Rate the following hat styles on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means you would never wear it and 10 means you would definitely wear it."

- **Comparison**. This is a form of multiple choice, but it's helpful to point out for the type of research you will be doing. You can suss out user preferences and perceptions more easily with comparison questions sometimes than with a list of abstract ideas. Example: \"Two travel cups are identical except one is totally recyclable and costs \$5 more. Which one would you buy?\"

## Write your questions and answer choices

A survey should be as brief as possible, but it is also your last best chance to collect the information you need (relatively few respondents will respond to a second, follow-up survey). Below are some tips; you can also read [this brief and readable article](https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/writing-survey-questions/) from Qualtrics about common pitfalls to avoid.

**Collect relevant demographic/background information**. Think carefully in advance about what demographics are relevant to your research questions. Demographics can be very helpful for analyzing data later, but there is no need to collect personal data if it is unnecessary for analysis.

**Strive for equity and dignity** in your data collection categories and in your language. If you need to know age, offer checkboxes with ranges instead of requiring an exact age. If you need to know gender, offer choices other than male and female (for example "non-binary" and "other"). If you need to know income level, ask respondents about "income level," not "class." For race and ethnicity data, carefully consider what needs to be captured and why, and do research on how \[link needed\], as these demographics can be multilayered.

**Be precise and thoughtful** in what you are asking respondents to assess. Make sure you are only asking them about one feature or factor in each question.

**Think carefully about when and why to ask open-ended questions**. This will make your analysis job vastly easier and more reliable. Open ended questions are messy and time-consuming for analysis, and you will find yourself forced to interpret people\'s meaning. That said, open-ended questions can yield a lot of information.

**Follow up as many questions as you can with "Why**." You will get much more insight into respondents' perspectives and reasoning. Some "Why" questions can be answered through multiple choice answers or a checklist -- use analyzable sources like that if possible. But be cognizant that you may accidentally silence people's experiences through your choice of answers; include "Other" with a short-answer line.

**Avoid asking the same things in an interview that you would in a survey**. Interviews are a deeper dive and more of a commitment for the respondent; you get less breadth of information, but more depth. Use these differences to your advantage.

**Be precise in your language**. When you ask how "easy" something is, are you talking about how much strength is needed? Knowledge? Familiarity? How intuitive is it?

**Ask one question per survey item**. For example, "Do you feel pogo sticks are too dangerous or silly to use as a method of transport?" is two different questions, if you're trying to determine which of those two reasons people don't like pogo stocks, and is actually a leading question, if you are trying to determine why people don't use them

**Ask precise questions**, always keeping in mind what you are trying to learn. For example, "Would you be willing to train for a half marathon" might not be enough information for your project. You might benefit from following up with questions about the most important factors leading to a Yes or No answer.

## Test the survey

**Have someone take your survey** and flag any parts that give them pause. Revise the survey and test it again.

## Prepare to distribute

**Write an introduction** to your survey to tell people in a sentence or two its purpose, its content, and how long it will take.

**Thank people** at the end of the survey.
