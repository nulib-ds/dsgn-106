## Observing

According to Driscoll (2011):

> Observations have led to some of the most important scientific discoveries in human history. Charles Darwin used observations of the animal and marine life at the Galapagos Islands to help him formulate his theory of evolution that he describes in _On the Origin of Species._ Today, social scientists, natural scientists, engineers, computer scientists, educational researchers, and many others use observations as a primary research method.
>
> Observations can be conducted on nearly any subject matter, and the kinds of observations you will do depend on \[the purpose of\] your research\...[^1]

### Conducting observations

The Oxford Dictionary (2020) defines the term "to observe" in the following important ways:

> 1.  Watch (someone or something) carefully and attentively
> 2.  Take note of or detect (something) in the course of a scientific study[^2]

When considering these definitions, a few things stand out:

> 1.  An observer watches carefully and attentively
> 2.  An observer takes note
> 3.  An observer arrives at realizations by detecting, or considering, noted facts

In design thinking, these definitions play an important role. As you begin to consider the design, you'll want to take note of several things. Such things may include what you're being asked to build; the users you're being asked to build it for; and why you're being asked to build it for those users. Even deeper, however, you'll want to actually go into the field and observe users to understand how the device you're being asked to build will have an impact on their lives, and why it's important that the users obtain such a device. In this way, you'll begin to understand what steps you need to take in order to build a design which benefits the users in the way intended.

If you are working on a project related to stroke rehabilitation, for example, you might observe a user at their physical therapist's office to get a sense of the kinds of things restricting them from doing what they enjoy. For example, if the user has carpal tunnel syndrome, they may be unable to hold a pen for a prolonged period of time. By observing them at their physical therapist's office, you get a sense of what's important to them and what's restricting them from engaging in these activities.

You might also observe a user as they use prototypes of the design you are developing. You might begin to understand how they interact with this design and what types of modifications you can make in order to make such interactions even more meaningful.

Of course, these are just a few of the observations you might conduct, and a few of the things you might discover when conducting these observations. In any case, you can apply the tips below to get the most from your observations. Remember to focus on observing, not interpreting! See Section 4 for how to capture your observations in a way to minimize bias.

### Identifying observation topics through a task breakdown

If you are expecting to observe a particular activity, such as how to use a device or how to complete a task, it can be helpful to do a task breakdown prior to the observation. This can give you specific actions to track in your observations. For example, if you are designing a new device for peeling vegetables and you plan to observe someone doing this in their home, you could first identify the key steps: retrieve their peeler from its storage location, retrieve other tools used, get the vegetables, peel, chop, transfer the peeled and chopped vegetables, cleanup, etc. Creating a task breakdown can also help you identify interview or survey questions to ask.

### What to observe

Clearly you will watch how the user performs the steps you identified in the task breakdown. As mentioned in the earlier section, _What is primary research?_, you should also look for workarounds, or adaptions that the user has made, often without realizing it, to make a particular product or situation work for them. Workarounds are a good indication that there is an opportunity to improve the user experience.

In addition to what the user does, take note of the environment and context, as they may impact the user' actions. Frameworks such as AEIOU and POEMS can be helpful reminders of what to observe. For each, the acronyms represent the types of data to collect, and that data is captured in a template. More information can be found in the links below.

- [AEIOU Observation Framework](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/aeiou-observation-framework/) - Activities, Environment, Interactions, Objects, and Users

- [POEMS Template for User Observations](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2017/09/20/poems-template-user-observation/) - People, Objects, Environments, Messages, and Services

As you use one of these frameworks, or an alternate approach for capturing what you observe, a summary of what to pay attention to and take note is listed below.

- Facial expressions and body language (remember to consider cultural differences and context later in assessing the potential for bias)

- Body positions (such as gripping, leaning, stretching to reach something, etc.)

- Pausing or hesitation

- Unexpected actions or workarounds

- Environmental conditions (sound, lighting, weather, etc.)

- Measurements of space, devices, etc. (where practical)

At any observation, be prepared to capture photos, video and/or audio recordings. Note that you must first get permission before doing this. It is often possible to both capture pictures _and_ protect the user's identity. For the carpal tunnel project example described earlier, you could take pictures or video of the user's hands as they write, without including their face or other identifiable features.

You should also be prepared to take measurements that might be relevant to the final design implementation. How big is the user's writing surface? Where might they store a writing aid and how much space is there? For some projects, it is not possible to take measurements. In these cases, you may be able to ask a project stakeholder for images, layouts, schematics, CAD files, or similar, or find some online.

### Using online videos for observations

Watching videos, from sources such as YouTube, can be used as a supplement to your primary research, or in cases when it truly isn't possible to observe the people or activities desired for the research project. For example, if you are designing a new cooking surface, or an appliance to be used on a stove, you are likely to do a number of contextual inquiry sessions in people's kitchens, to understand how they interact with their cooking surfaces. You could also consider watching some online cooking videos for additional insights from a broader range of users than you might be able to visit in person.

Videos are better as a supplement to actual observation than as a replacement, as they might not tell the real story. Before making a video, someone might have created a specific setup, such as cleaning their cooking surface and arranging their kitchen to improve the video quality, as opposed to showing how their kitchen looks on a typical day. People also tend to edit videos before posting them, which could eliminate some important details. Have a plan for what you hope to learn, and consider what bias might be present. You might also be able to do some additional observations or interviews with real users to follow up on any insights from online videos.

## Writing questions for interviews and surveys

Interviews and surveys are two ways that you can gather information about people's beliefs or behaviors. With these methods, the information you collect is not first-hand (like an observation) but rather "self-reported" data, or data collected in an indirect manner. William Shadish, Thomas Cook, and Donald Campbell argued that people are inherently biased about how they see the world and may report their own actions in a more favorable way than they may actually behave.[^3] Despite the issues in self-reported data, surveys and interviews are an excellent way to gather data for your primary research project.

### Survey or interview?

How do you choose between conducting a survey or an interview? It depends on what kind of information you are looking for. You should use surveys if you want to learn about a general trend in people's opinions, experiences, and behavior. Surveys are particularly useful to find small amounts of information from a wider selection of people in the hopes of making a general claim. Interviews are best used when you want to learn detailed information from a few specific people.

### Writing good questions

One of the greatest challenges in conducting surveys and interviews is writing good questions. As a researcher, you are always trying to eliminate bias, and the questions you ask need to be unbiased and clear. Here are some suggestions on writing good questions:

**Ask about one thing at a time**

A poorly written question can contain multiple questions, which can confuse participants or lead them to answer only part of the question you are asking. This is called a "double-barreled question" in journal- ism. See how the following poor question was revised to be more effective:

> **Poor question:** What kinds of problems are being faced in the field today and where do you see the search for solutions to these problems going?
>
> **Revised question #1:** What kinds of problems are being faced in the field today?
>
> **Revised question #2:** Where do you see the search for solutions to these problems going?

**Avoid leading questions**

A leading question is one where you prompt the participant to respond in a particular way, which can create bias in the answers given:

> **Leading question:** The economy is clearly in a crisis, wouldn't you agree?
>
> **Revised question:** Do you believe the economy is currently in a crisis? Why or why not?

When asking questions in person or through virtual meeting software, be aware of your body language and facial expressions. Maintaining a sort of visible neutrality will help you avoid a type of response bias, where respondents adjust what they say based on perceived approval or disapproval from the interviewer or others.

**Understand when to use open and closed questions**

Closed questions, or questions that have yes/no or other limited responses, should be used in surveys. However, avoid these kinds of questions in interviews because they discourage the interviewee from going into depth. The question sample above, "Do you believe the economy currently is in a crisis?" could be answered with a simple yes or no, which could keep a participant from talking more about the issue. The "why or why not?" portion of the question asks the participant to elaborate. On a survey, the question "Do you believe the economy currently is in a crisis?" is a useful question because you can easily count the number of yes and no answers and make a general claim about participant responses.

**Write clear questions**

When you write questions, make sure they are clear, concise, and to the point. Questions that are too long, use unfamiliar vocabulary, or are unclear may confuse participants and you will not get quality responses. Consider your word choice carefully. Use precise words and review your questions carefully to ensure they can't be misinterpreted in some way. This is especially important with written questions, where you can't clarify or correct your question on the spot.

For surveys, just as important as question creating is answer choice creation. Answer choices must follow all the same guidelines as questions in terms of precision, neutrality, and clarity. They must also reflect options that will resonate with the entirety of your target user group, not just a subset of the group that most resembles your own demographic profile. This may seem obvious, but it can be quite difficult to recognize one's own assumptions.

If you find your list of answer choices is getting lengthy or unwieldy, you probably need to craft your question differently. See [Appendix A](#bookmark0) for a comprehensive guide to planning and writing surveys. You can also see some additional examples in the blog, "[How to craft interviews for breakthrough insights,](https://web.archive.org/web/20160422010446/http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/products/how-to-craft-user-interviews-for-breakthrough-insights)" by Jason Amunwa.

### Face-to-face and virtual interviews

When interviewing, you have a choice of conducting a traditional, face-to-face interview or an interview using technology over the Internet. Face-to-face interviews have the strength that you can ask follow-up questions and use non-verbal communication to your advantage. Individuals are able to say much more in a face-to-face interview than in an email, so you will get more information from a face-to-face interview. However, the Internet provides a host of new possibilities when it comes to interviewing people at a distance. You may choose to do an email interview, where you send questions and ask the person to respond. You may also choose to use a video or audio conferencing program to talk with the person virtually. If you are choosing any Internet-based option, make sure you have a way of recording the interview. You may also use a chat or instant messaging program to interview your participant -- the benefit of this is that you can ask follow-up questions during the interview and the interview is already transcribed for you.

In a qualitative interview, the researcher usually develops a guide in advance that he or she then refers to during the interview (or memorizes in advance of the interview). An interview guide is a list of topics or questions that the interviewer hopes to cover during the course of an interview. It is called a guide because it is simply that -- it is used to guide the interviewer, but it is not set in stone. Think of an interview guide like your agenda for the day or your to-do list -- both probably contain all the items you hope to check off or accomplish, though it probably won't be the end of the world if you don't accomplish everything on the list or if you don't accomplish it in the exact order that you have it written down. Perhaps new events will come up that cause you to rearrange your schedule just a bit, or perhaps you simply won't get to everything on the list.

Interview guides should outline issues that a researcher feels are likely to be important, but because participants are asked to provide answers in their own words, and to raise points that they believe are important, each interview is likely to flow a little differently. While the opening question in an in-depth interview may be the same across all interviews, from that point on what the participant says will shape how the interview proceeds. This, I believe, is what makes in-depth interviewing so exciting. It is also what makes in-depth interviewing rather challenging to conduct. It takes a skilled interviewer to be able to ask questions; actually listen to respondents; and pick up on cues about when to follow up, when to move on, and when to simply let the participant speak without guidance or interruption.

As you might have guessed, interview guides do not appear out of thin air. They are the result of thoughtful and careful work on the part of a researcher. As you can see in both of the preceding guides, the topics and questions have been organized thematically and in the order in which they are likely to proceed (though keep in mind that the flow of a qualitative interview is in part determined by what a respondent has to say). Sometimes qualitative interviewers may create two versions of the interview guide: one version contains a very brief outline of the interview, perhaps with just topic headings, and another version contains detailed questions underneath each topic heading. In this case, the researcher might use the very detailed guide to prepare and practice in advance of actually conducting interviews and then just bring the brief outline to the interview. Bringing an outline, as opposed to a very long list of detailed questions, to an interview encourages the researcher to actually listen to what a participant is telling her. An overly detailed interview guide will be difficult to navigate through during an interview and could give respondents the misimpression that the interviewer is more interested in her questions than in the participant's answers.

When beginning to construct an interview guide, brainstorming is usually the first step. There are no rules at the brainstorming stage -- simply list all the topics and questions that come to mind when you think about your research question. Once you've got a pretty good list, you can begin to pare it down by cutting questions and topics that seem redundant and group like questions and topics together. If you haven't done so yet, you may also want to come up with question and topic headings for your grouped categories. You should also consult the scholarly literature to find out what kinds of questions other interviewers have asked in studies of similar topics. As with quantitative survey research, it is best not to place very sensitive or potentially controversial questions at the very beginning of your qualitative interview guide. You need to give participants the opportunity to warm up to the interview and to feel comfortable talking with you. Finally, get some feedback on your interview guide. Ask your friends, family members, and your professors for some guidance and suggestions once you've come up with what you think is a pretty strong guide. Chances are they'll catch a few things you hadn't noticed.

In terms of the specific questions you include on your guide, there are a few guidelines worth noting. First, try to avoid questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no, or if you do choose to include such questions, be sure to include follow-up questions. Remember, one of the benefits of qualitative interviews is that you can ask participants for more information -- be sure to do so. While it is a good idea to ask follow-up questions, try to avoid asking "why" as your follow-up question, as this particular question can come off as confrontational, even if that is not how you intend it. Often people won't know how to respond to "why," perhaps because they don't even know why themselves. Instead of "why," I recommend that you say something like, "Could you tell me a little more about that?" This allows participants to explain themselves further without feeling that they're being doubted or questioned in a hostile way.

Also, try to avoid phrasing your questions in a leading way. For example, rather than asking, "Don't you think that most people who don't want kids are selfish?" you could ask, "What comes to mind for you when you hear that someone doesn't want kids?" Or rather than asking, "What do you think about juvenile delinquents who drink and drive?" you could ask, "How do you feel about underage drinking?" or "What do you think about drinking and driving?" Finally, as noted earlier in this section, remember to keep most, if not all, of your questions open ended. The key to a successful qualitative interview is giving participants the opportunity to share information in their own words and in their own way.

## Surveys

Other than the fact that they both involve asking people questions, interviews and surveys are quite different data collection methods. Creating a survey may seem easy at first, but developing a quality survey can be quite challenging. When conducting a survey, you need to focus on the following areas: survey creation, survey testing, survey sampling, and distributing your survey.

### Survey creation: length and types of questions

One of the keys to creating a successful survey is to keep your survey short and focused. Participants are unlikely to fill out a survey that is lengthy, and you'll have a more difficult time during your analysis if your survey contains too many questions. In most cases, you want your survey to be something that can be filled out within a few minutes. The target length of the survey also depends on how you will distribute the survey. If you are giving your survey to other students in your dorm or classes, they will have more time to complete the survey. Therefore, five to ten minutes to complete the survey is reasonable. If you are asking students as they are walking to class to fill out your survey, keep it limited to several questions that can be answered in thirty seconds or less.

Use closed questions to your advantage when creating your survey. A closed question is any set of questions that gives a limited amount of choices (yes/no, a 1--5 scale, choose the statement that best describes you). When creating closed questions, be sure that you are accounting for all reasonable answers in your question creation. For example, asking someone "Do you believe you eat healthy?" and providing them only "yes" and "no" options means that a "neutral" or "undecided" option does not exist, even though the survey respondent may not feel strongly either way. Therefore, on closed questions you may find it helpful to include an "other" category where participants can fill in an answer. It is also a good idea to have a few open-ended questions where participants can elaborate on certain points or earlier responses. However, open-ended questions take much longer to fill out than closed questions, and generate results that are more difficult to analyze.

### Survey creation: testing your survey

To make sure your survey is an appropriate length and that your questions are clear, you can "pilot test" your survey. Prior to administering your survey on a larger scale, ask several classmates or friends to fill it out and give you feedback on the survey. Keep track of how long the survey takes to complete. Ask them if the questions are clear and make sense. Look at their answers to see if the answers match what you wanted to learn. You can revise your survey questions and the length of your survey as necessary.

### Sampling and access to survey populations

"Sampling" is the term used in research to refer to the group of people who will be included in your survey, interviews, or other research activities. You need to identify both your target population and how you will reach them, and also consider how likely they are to respond to your survey. You might choose to use physical survey forms in a classroom or building entrance, or create an interactive scenario, such as passers-by dropping a token into one of three bins representing which issue concerns them the most, or you might create an online survey. The number and diversity of respondents will vary greatly across these approaches.

Each of these methods for selecting a sample population introduce bias. Watch [this brief video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1R00l8Z5lg) to learn more about common sampling bias pitfalls, and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdXDLNNXPik) for some ideas on avoiding these pitfalls. You might not be able to eliminate all bias in your survey sample. This is fine in the context of your undergraduate course; it is hard to do even for professional researchers. But it is important to be aware of the bias present in your sample selection, not only so you can document it as a limitation in your research report, but so you develop habits of mind that will impel you to seek unbiased sampling methods in future research in your schooling and career.

Implicit bias is also an ever-present issue to take steps to avoid. Even science-based researchers and practitioners inadvertently bring in personal and cultural biases to their work. Two ways to reduce implicit bias in your survey are a) write good survey questions and answer choices, and b) proactively work to ensure racial, ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic diversity in your sample.

Let's look at a couple examples for proactively inviting diversity. Imagine you want to survey people who are at risk of carpal tunnel syndrome due to their work. You might have easy access through family members to a population of office workers. But garment workers, electricians, and musicians are also at risk for this syndrome, and might have different sets of circumstances related to treatment, task switching, and other factors.

Or perhaps you want to survey engineering undergrads. You could post notices around your engineering building and library. But you could also reach out to student groups at your university such as the National Society for Black Engineers (NSBE), Society for Women Engineers (SWE), and others.
