## Clarify the research question(s)

In her article, _Introduction to Primary Research_, Dana Lynn Driscoll (2011)[^1] discusses primary research. Consider the excerpt from Driscoll's article below, taking note of how you might apply this information to your own research:

> Primary research is often based on principles of the scientific method, a theory of investigation first developed by John Stuart Mill in the nineteenth century in his book _Philosophy of the Scientific Method.[^1]_ Although the application of the scientific method varies from field to field, the general principles of the scientific method allow researchers to learn more about the world and observable phenomena. Using the scientific method, researchers develop research questions or hypotheses and collect data on events, objects, or people that is measurable, observable, and replicable. The ultimate goal in conducting primary research is to learn about something new that can be confirmed by others and to eliminate our own biases in the process.[^2]

Driscoll goes on to discuss Fred Leavitt's _Evaluating Scientific Research: Separating Fact from Fiction,[^3]_ explaining that primary research is useful for questions that can be answered through asking others and direct observation:

> Primary research is particularly useful when you want to learn about a problem that does not have a wealth of published information. This may be because the problem is a recent event or it is something not commonly studied. For example, if you are designing a device for a particular user with carpal tunnel syndrome, which is a condition that affects people in different ways, you may not know exactly how this condition affects this user. You'll want to collect data about this user directly, perhaps through observation or interview. Or if you're developing a website for teachers who are required to teach online during a pandemic, and you'd like to include information about developing lesson plans, you might want to survey a population of teachers to determine what information they'd find most necessary.[^3]

### Narrowing your topic

Just like the writing process, you should start your primary research process with secondary (library) research to learn more about what is already known and what gaps you need to fill with your own data. As you learn more about the topic, you can narrow down your interest area and eventually develop a research question or hypothesis, just as you would with a secondary research paper.

### Developing research questions or hypotheses

As John Stuart Mill describes in his book, _Philosophy of the Scientific Method_, primary research can use both _inductive_ and _deductive_ approaches, and the type of approach is usually based on the field of inquiry. Some fields use _deductive reasoning,_ where researchers start with a hypothesis or general conclusion and then collect specific data to support or refute their hypothesis. Other fields use _inductive reasoning,_ where researchers start with a question and collect information that eventually leads to a conclusion.[^6]

Once you have spent some time reviewing the secondary research on your topic, you are ready to write a primary research question or hypothesis. A research question or hypothesis should be something that is specific, narrow, and discoverable through primary research methods. Just like a thesis statement for a paper, if your research question or hypothesis is too broad, your research will be unfocused and your data will be difficult to analyze and write about. Here is a set of sample research questions:

> _Vague Research Question:_ What are the issues affecting people with carpal tunnel syndrome?
>
> _Revised Research Question:_ What muscles in the hand are specifically affected by carpal tunnel syndrome, and how does this affect people's use of pencils and other writing implements?

The first research question above is too vague as to what specific issues the researcher is interested in, and how those issues relate to the device the researcher is designing. The vague research question was also too broad, covering too much ground for a single project. The revised question narrows down the topic to muscles in the hand and their effect on writing. The research question could also be rephrased as a testable hypothesis using deductive reasoning: "Certain muscles in the hand, made weaker by carpal tunnel syndrome, have a direct effect on writing."

A final step in working with a research question or hypothesis is determining what key terms you are using and how you will define them. Before conducting their research, the researchers in the example above will need to define phrases such as "use of pencils" and "writing implements" in order to focus their research and determine how these things might be measured.

## A Plan for Primary Research

The research you conduct in a user-centered design project requires that you learn about your identified users to understand the problems these users face and unmet needs they have. This, then, will help you determine the requirements for your design.

To develop your understanding about these issues, you'll conduct primary research. This research might take the form of observations, interviews, and surveys as discussed in Section 1. This section will provide you with several steps to develop a research plan.

**Step one.** Free write. For five minutes without stopping, write about the information you need to know. This information might be related to your user, your user's reasons for contacting you (i.e., carpal tunnel syndrome), your design, etc.

**Step two.** Review your freewrite from Step One. Develop research questions. Based on the information you need to know, develop questions to help you focus your research.

**Step three**. Identify which research methods you can use to help you discover the information you need to know. For example, observations enable you to learn more about your user by watching them in action; interviews help you learn more about your user by asking them specific questions, and surveys help you learn more about a larger population by asking them questions. Additional research methods were described in Section 1.

**Step four.** Compare the research questions you listed with the research methods you identified, and decide which questions you want to answer using which methods.

**Step five.** Develop a plan for research. Read Sections 3 and 4 for more details on how to complete your plan. For example, if you're conducting observations, you'll want to create a five-column chart. If you're conducting interviews or a survey, you'll want to develop specific questions.

**Step six.** Decide on a research population. Your population may consist only of one particular user, or several users, or others who can help you answer your questions. Decide who you will contact for observations, interviews, and/or surveys, and how you will contact them. Here, you'll want to be specific. If you want to interview people with carpal tunnel syndrome, for example, you may want to decide on age, gender, profession, how long they've had carpal tunnel, etc. This will help you to narrow your focus. You may also want to speak to occupational therapists or other experts who will have a different perspective.

## Be open to new information

One thing to keep in mind as you conduct your research is that it's important to be open to new information. Each piece of research that you conduct will lead you to new information. This information may differ from what you've already learned about your topic(s), and/or it may lead you in new directions. Each time this happens, it means you're getting closer to your goal of uncovering the truth about your topic, insomuch as that truth relates to the user's needs. The closer you get to the truth, the closer your design gets to matching what your user needs.

Whenever you uncover new information, ask yourself: How does this information relate to the information my team and I have already uncovered? It may do one of the following things:

### Add to information

Your new information will add to information already uncovered if it provides you more details, but doesn't contradict the details you've already learned. In this case, be sure to add this information to your existing database of information. Also, ask yourself: Is there more we can learn from this information? If so, conduct additional research.

For example, let's say that you've already uncovered the fact that a user with carpal tunnel syndrome experiences pain in their hand as they write. Through additional research, you've also discovered that this user may experience numbness in their hand. In this case, you'll probably want to research what causes this numbness and what type of writing implement you might create in order to alleviate this symptom. The fact that carpal tunnel causes numbness doesn't contradict that it causes pain; it adds to the knowledge of symptoms your team has uncovered about carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Contradict information

In other cases, you might realize that new information contradicts information your team has already uncovered. In this case, you'll want to conduct new research to check for accuracy. For example, if one resource claims that carpal tunnel affects Muscle X, while another resource claims it affects Muscle Y, and writing affects each muscle differently (so that this new information doesn't add, but instead contradicts), you'll want to discover which muscles are really affected by carpal tunnel syndrome so that you can take them into account when designing your prototype.

### The bottom line

The bottom line is that as you and your team conduct research, you'll uncover important facts pertinent to your project. Keep an open mind as you uncover these facts, and use your research to bolster your knowledge to ensure the design works well with the user's needs.
