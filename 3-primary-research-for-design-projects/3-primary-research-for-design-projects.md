## Overview
*Primary Research for Design Projects* was authored by three Northwestern University professors: Stacy Benjamin from the Segal Design Institute, and Kaara Kallen and Michele Zugnoni from the Cook Family Writing Program. Each contributed distinct expertise, resulting in a cohesive three-chapter guide to primary research. Chapter one introduces foundational research techniques and explores ethical considerations. Chapter two focuses on setting clear goals and planning research effectively. Chapter three outlines practical methods for conducting observations, interviews, and surveys. We invite you to click on the links for each chapter.
