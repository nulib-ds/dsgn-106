As you engage in observation, you'll want to ensure that you focus on the details and the facts. According to Driscoll (2011):

> The ethical concern of being unbiased is important in recording your observations. You need to be aware of the difference between an observation (recording exactly what you see) and an interpretation (making assumptions and judgments about what you see). When you observe, you should focus first on only the events that are directly observable.[^1]

Driscoll (2011) gives the following entries in an observation log as an example:

> 1.  The student sitting in the dining hall enjoys his greasy, oil-soaked pizza. He is clearly oblivious of the calorie content and damage it may do to his body.
>
> 2.  The student sits in the dining hall. As he eats his piece of pizza, which drips oil, he says to a friend, "This pizza is good."[^1]

What are your thoughts about each of these entries? Is one entry more biased than the other?

Let's look at the entries one-by-one. Driscoll (2011) points out that in the first entry, "the observer makes assumptions about the internal state of the student when she writes 'enjoys' and 'clearly oblivious to the calorie content'" (p. 161).[^1] However, the observer doesn't detail what she actually knows about the pizza's nutritional value or how she knows that the student is enjoying the slice.

In the second entry, the observer includes only the observable details and facts.

As you record your observational notes, you'll want to be careful to include only details and facts. Otherwise, you might incorporate bias into your notes, making it difficult to understand the situation in its organic truth.

One way to guard against bias is to create a five-column observational chart which gives you room to include your own thoughts and perceptions, so that you can later evaluate your thoughts and perceptions and determine whether they're valid and important for your design. Such an observational sheet might look like this:

Table 3.1 Observation notes on student eating pizza

Let's consider each of these columns in detail.

        I’m really not sure whether user always has trouble holding pencils, or maybe if it’s just this pencil.

**Details of observation**. In this column, the observer only wrote down details and facts. This enables them to draw upon these details and facts when writing up their report. By eliminating personal opinions, it reduces bias in the report, and can allow others to potentially identify additional insights or questions.

**Knowledge making**. In this column, the observer thought more deeply about the details and facts of their observation. They formed new knowledge based on what they observed. This, then, enabled them to take their details a step further by forming conclusions from those details.

**Knowledge re-making**. In this column, the observer reflected even deeper into their conclusions. They began to form hypotheses.

**Internal biases**. In this column, the observer checked their hypotheses for bias. They began to understand that some of their hypotheses may be unfounded, or may be infused with bias, thus weakening their standing.

**Things to consider**. In this column, the observer considers their biases and begins to understand there may be other reasons this student is eating a gooey slice of pizza. Herein, then, is an unknown: The researcher realizes that there's more they need to learn about this situation. They reevaluate what they know, and formulate next steps for research. Perhaps the researcher will want to conduct an interview with this student and others in order to find out more. The researcher might have new questions to ask as a result of examining their biases, such as what, when, and where the student typically eats and the importance of cost in making selections.

Now let's apply this situation to design by using another example. Let's return to an example of a user who has carpal tunnel syndrome.

Table 3.2 Observation notes on user trying to write

<table style="border=1px">

    <tr>
      <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Details of observation</th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Knowledge making</th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Knowledge re-making</th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Internal biases</th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Things to consider</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">User’s hand shakes when they hold a pencil.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">User seems to have difficulty holding a pencil.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Maybe the pencil is too small for user’s large hand.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">My hand is small, so maybe I’m misjudging how big user’s hand is.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">
        I’m really not sure whether user always has trouble holding pencils, or maybe if it’s just this pencil.
        I also understand that I can be judgmental because I have such good penmanship.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">User corrects their grip by pushing the pencil further into their grip.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">User seems to be working hard to hold the pencil in their grip.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Maybe user needs to relearn how to hold a pencil.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">I have really good penmanship, so I don’t understand when others can’t hold pencils right.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">User’s writing is wobbly.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">User seems unable to write legibly.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Maybe user’s handwriting is always illegible, even without carpal tunnel.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">See above</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">User sighs and tosses pencil onto the table without finishing their letter.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">User seems frustrated and gives up.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">User is impatient and gave up too easily.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">I don’t really understand what it’s like to have carpal tunnel, so I’m judging user.</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px; width: 30%">
        Maybe “not giving up” actually aggravates the problem. The fact that I’ve never had chronic pain is making it a little hard for me to empathize.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

In this example, the researcher realizes that there's more they need to know about carpal tunnel syndrome -- not only the mechanics of the syndrome, but its psychological and lifestyle implications. As such, they choose to conduct a contextual inquiry where they have the user demonstrate their grip with writing implements of various sizes and ask the user questions about the effects carpal tunnel has had on their everyday life.
