## Introduction

How research is defined varies widely from field to field, and as you progress through your college career, your coursework will teach you much more about what it means to be a researcher within your field. For example, engineers, who focus on applying scientific knowledge to develop designs, processes, and objects, conduct research using simulations, mathematical models, and a variety of tests to see how well their designs work. Sociologists conduct research using surveys, interviews, observations, and statistical analysis to better understand people, societies, and cultures. Graphic designers conduct research through locating images for reference for their artwork and engaging in background research on clients and companies to best serve their needs. Historians conduct research by examining archival materials -- newspapers, journals, letters, and other surviving texts -- and through conducting oral history interviews. Research is not limited to what has already been written or found at the library, also known as secondary research. Rather, individuals conducting research are producing the articles and reports found in a library database or in a book. Primary research, the focus of this essay, is research that is collected firsthand rather than found in a book, database, or journal.

Primary research is often based on principles of the scientific method, a theory of investigation first developed by John Stuart Mill[^1] in the nineteenth century in his book Philosophy of the Scientific Method. Although the application of the scientific method varies from field to field, the general principles of the scientific method allow researchers to learn more about the world and observable phenomena. Using the scientific method, researchers develop research questions or hypotheses and collect data on events, objects, or people that is measurable, observable, and replicable. The ultimate goal in conducting primary research is to learn about something new that can be confirmed by others and to eliminate our own biases in the process.

Following are some common types of primary design research, and some important guidelines for cultivating an ethical and equitable research practice. In the next section, you'll read about setting the foundation for reaching your research goals. In Section 3 you'll find useful information about conducting different types of research such as interviews, observations, and surveys. And, finally, you'll read about presenting your research as reliably as possible, by analyzing (Section 4) and documenting (Section 5) it.

## Common types of primary design research

Primary research plays an essential role in building the empathy and understanding needed for user- centered design. Developing a first-hand understanding of a user's experience requires thought and planning. Users communicate their needs verbally, and also nonverbally, through facial expressions, demeanor, and other unconscious means. Users will often readily communicate a solution they have in mind, though they might not have a clear and complete analysis of the problem. Each user's experience indicates universal needs, and is at the same time entirely unique. In order to make the most of your primary research in the context of user-centered design, it is essential to identify and knowledgeably apply the most suitable research method(s) for the target user population and design goals.

### Observations

There are multiple types of observation. For example, in naturalistic observation, the researcher observes an activity in the setting where it would normally occur, without any involvement themselves. In a controlled observation, the researcher may arrange an activity and invite people to participate, and then observe what they do. This may or may not be in the natural setting. There are also types of observational research in which the researcher might play an active role. In each of these, the focus of the researcher is on watching, with an open mind, and capturing details of what they see. This may include body language, facial expressions, body position, specific interactions with products or other participants, moments of hesitation, and so on.

While many types of observation are qualitative (results are textured and descriptive), behavioral observation is a quantitative method (results can be measured). Using this method, the researcher codes or tallies certain specific behaviors over time. For example, a researcher interested in students' eating habits might code students' lunch purchases during two-hour observations conducted at a specific cafeteria every Monday over the course of a year. The researcher could then analyze their data to see patterns such as popularity of specific items and changes in purchases over time.

Observations have the advantage of enabling the researcher to see what someone actually does, as opposed to what they say they do, which might not be the same thing for a variety of reasons.

Drawbacks to observations can include limited access for observing the desired activity in as real a setting as possible, and of course, if there is no discussion with the person being observed, it isn't possible to fully understand their underlying needs or motivation. Something to keep in mind is that the researcher observes and acts through their own worldview and using their own experiences, and should therefore be aware of the potential for bias and cultural assumptions in their observation.

### Interviews

Interviews can be used to establish rapport, develop empathy, and get a better understanding of someone's thoughts and actions as well as their underlying needs or motivation. Like most observations, interviewing is generally qualitative.

Design researchers may conduct interviews with a target user, as well as with other stakeholders, and subject matter experts (SMEs). Interviews can be done by email, phone, video call, or in person. When done by email, interviewees have more time to think about and compose their answer, and can answer at their convenience, but the interviewer is not able to ask follow-up questions. Video or in-person interviews are preferable to phone interviews because the researcher can ask follow-up questions as well as look for non-verbal communication such as facial expressions.

Phone, virtual, and in-person interviews permit the researcher to ask "why" -- this simple, one-word question is a powerful tool for unpacking users' experiences and worldview. Two ways to reduce researcher bias in interviews are to craft questions that invite the user without leading them, and to listen with an open and empathetic mind.

### Contextual inquiry

Contextual inquiry (also referred to as an in-depth interview) is an approach that combines observing people in their natural environment with an interview. Instead of just passively watching the person, you also ask questions to better understand underlying motivations, beliefs, and emotions that may be influencing their actions. For example, if you are observing someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome as they write a note, you will be able to see some of the challenges they experience and any adaptations they have found to make it easier for them (referred to as "workarounds"). In contextual inquiry, you can also ask them about _why_ they developed that approach, what else they have tried and what were the results, what is still problematic about what they do now, and so on. In this approach, it is important to apply the same guidelines for both effective observations _and_ for effective interviews.

### Textual analysis

Textual analysis is an approach for drawing insights from qualitative, textual data by looking at the content and structure of that data, and understanding the historical and cultural context that existed when the data was created. Datasets can include transcripts from interviews, survey results, product reviews, social media posts, and much more. Within textual analysis, there are many specific analytical tools that can be applied, such as looking at word frequency, word collocation (groups of words that frequently appear together), coding and tagging groups of text by topic, and others. Textual analysis is most often used for research projects involving large data sets of unstructured data, and there are many software tools that can be used to help conduct that analysis.

Language is a powerful carrier of cultural assumptions and priorities. In order to reduce inadvertent bias, researchers who conduct cultural analysis must have a strong understanding of how their own worldview and use of language might interplay with their research goals and with their use of analytical tools.

### Surveys

A survey is a set of questions posed without variance to many users, potential users, or stakeholders. Often the answer choices as well as the questions are limited to some degree, through methods such as multiple choice, rating, and ranking.

Since surveys are sent to multiple respondents and the resulting data is quantitative, they can yield patterns or tendencies across a group. This can be an important step toward reliability in research results because researchers are capturing a spectrum of experiences rather than a few individual anecdotes. For example, a researcher observing two people who recently recovered from carpal tunnel surgery may incorrectly conclude that surgery is the primary treatment for carpal tunnel; a survey would reveal other treatments such as therapy, splinting, cortisone shots, and occupational/habit changes.

Surveys also have the advantage of yielding a relatively large amount of data with a relatively small expenditure of time and resources. That said, they do not yield the same depth of understanding or richness as qualitative methods. While surveys are a good tool for surveying a user group's habits and preferences, they are limited in their ability to reach the "why" of those habits and preferences, or for cultivating empathy. Two ways to mitigate potential researcher bias are to strive for a representative sample of respondents and to craft survey questions and answers with bias in mind.

One efficient method for making use of both qualitative and quantitative methods is to administer a survey and then select a few willing survey respondents for qualitative follow-up (make sure your survey contains a question asking for volunteers).

### Focus groups

A focus group is a small group of people that a researcher assembles in order to gather qualitative information from a variety of voices at once. It is more common to use focus groups to gather feedback on concepts and prototypes than to use them at the beginning of the design research process, since observations and interviews would be less practical in a group setting. Because there are multiple users represented in a focus group, the focus group cannot take place in the user's natural setting. A focus group might be held in an office setting, or at a location that is similar to the natural setting. The main advantage of a focus group is the ability to hear from different perspectives in a single session. However, there can be significant limitations; for example, people who are more introverted might be hesitant to share their opinions, and people with strong personalities could dominate a conversation and even sway others to their point of view. The focus group should be designed to create a non-threatening environment and structured to encourage equal participation from all users. Many of the strategies behind designing effective interview and survey questions, discussed in Section 3, can also be applied to focus groups.

## Ethics of primary research

As Earl Babbie writes in _The Practice of Social Research,_[^2] throughout the early and middle parts of the twentieth century researchers took advantage of participants and treated them unethically. During World War II, Nazi doctors performed heinous experiments on prisoners without their consent, while in the U.S., a number of medical and psychological experiments on caused patients undue mental and physical trauma and, in some cases, death. Because of these and other similar events, many nations have established ethical laws and guidelines for researchers who work with human participants. In the United States, the guidelines for the ethical treatment of human research participants are described in _The Belmont Report,_ released in 1979. Today, universities have Institutional Review Boards (or IRBs) that oversee research. Students conducting research as part of a class may not need permission from the university's IRB, although they still need to ensure that they follow ethical guidelines in research. The following provides a brief overview of ethical considerations:

- _Voluntary participation_. _The Belmont Report_ suggests that, in most cases, you need to get permission from people before you involve them in any primary research you are conducting. If you are doing a survey or interview, your participants must first agree to fill out your survey or to be interviewed. Consent for observations can be more complicated, and is dis- cussed later in the essay.

- _Confidentiality and anonymity_. Your participants may reveal embarrassing or potentially damaging information such as racist comments or unconventional behavior. In these cases, you should keep your participants' identities anonymous when writing your results. An easy way to do this is to create a "pseudonym" (or false name) for them so that their identity is protected.

- _Researcher bias_. There is little point in collecting data and learning about something if you already think you know the answer! Bias might be present in the way you ask questions, the way you take notes, or the conclusions you draw from the data you collect.

The above are only three of many considerations when involving human participants in your primary research. For a complete understanding of ethical considerations please refer to [The Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html).

## Guiding principles for racial and ethnic equity in primary research

Every research or evaluation project is unique in its approach. Each project seeks to answer a specific range of research questions; thus, there can be no universal prescriptive formula for how to embed a racial and equity perspective in research. However, foundational principles can guide each research project to intentionally embed a racial and ethnic equity perspective. Based on 34 interviews with researchers, funders, academics, community practitioners, and policymakers; a thorough literature review; and the deep research experience and expertise of Child Trends scientists, Andrews, _et al._[^3] developed five guiding principles on how to use this approach in every phase of research (from designing the study to reporting findings).

### 1. Researchers should examine their own backgrounds and biases.

Researchers strive to be neutral and objective; nevertheless, they have our own biases, values, background, and experiences that affect the way they conduct research. Bias affects the decisions made throughout the research process, including who asks the research questions, which questions are asked, whose input on the research is sought, how the data are gathered, how findings are interpreted and communicated, and which audiences and methods are selected for dissemination. Researchers should examine their own racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds, as well as their experiences (or lack of experiences) with racism and/or privilege, and consider how they influence the direction of research.

### 2. They should make a commitment to dig deeper into the data.

While recognizing differences in outcomes among racial and ethnic groups is a first step in identifying disparities, it does not address them. Addressing disparities requires researchers to move beyond simply documenting them: We must also identify the underlying systemic and contextual causes of disparities. This focus is especially critical for understanding outcomes in communities of color, where truths have historically been distorted or overlooked to perpetuate racist systems and beliefs. We should dig deeper to uncover whether data points to a legacy of racism or systemic inequities at the root of racial and ethnic differences in outcomes, rather than an intrinsic deficit of the population in question. To dig deeper into the data requires that we ask questions to uncover root causes of disparities, seek the involvement and perspectives of community stakeholders, and invest adequate time and money in designing and implementing the research.[^4]

### 3. Researchers should also recognize that the research process itself has an impact on communities, and that researchers have a role in ensuring that research benefits communities.

Historically, researchers have employed practices that resulted in the inhumane abuse and exploitation of communities and people of color. Researchers have obtained data on communities and then left without addressing the issues of the people they studied. By doing so, researchers have reinforced a paradigm in which they enter a community and conduct research without giving back;[^5] in this way, they have added to the abuse and exploitation that vulnerable communities already face.

Particularly in communities of color where there is a history of research that caused harm or mistrust, researchers should embed a racial and ethnic equity perspective to repair this relationship.

Ethical research must be reciprocal. The people who give researchers consent to use their data should receive something in return. For example, when conducting research with American Indian populations, researchers need to consider tribal sovereignty and data ownership.

Honoring a community also means acknowledging the often-overlooked power that communities of color hold. Research that incorporates a racial and ethnic equity perspective can help to reveal a community's power and dismantle power differentials that currently exist between researcher and communities of color.

### 4. Researchers should engage communities as partners in research and credit them for their contribution.

To incorporate a racial and ethnic equity perspective, researchers must authentically engage community stakeholders. The meaning given to data is influenced by who analyzes it. Community stakeholders -- people who are experiencing the issue that researchers are interested in -- can be engaged in the data analysis and offer a perspective that differs from that of researchers.

Researchers should genuinely work together with communities to accurately and effectively present information; this collaboration could include defining the issue of interest and brainstorming solutions to address it. Community-engaged research considers a community's culture, relationships, and policies. In this way, it is a mechanism for embedding a racial and ethnic equity perspective to research. Early community engagement is ideal and should continue through every stage of the research process.

Community engagement is an acknowledgement of a community's contribution to the research and is important for promoting a true partnership.

#### 5. Finally, they should guard against the implied or explicit assumption that white is the normative, standard, or default position.

Researchers typically make comparisons to white outcomes when they examine disparities. Such comparisons reflect the assumption that white outcomes are the standard, and that communities of color should aim to achieve that standard. These comparisons also apply positive values to cultural norms associated with whiteness and negatively measure people of color by those norms. Making comparisons to white people neglects the structural factors and root causes that may lead to disparities.

A racial and ethnic equity approach moves beyond looking at disparities or "closing gaps" and shifts the focus to better outcomes for all while acknowledging that tailored solutions are necessary.

## Gender equity in primary research

Women and girls -- their experiences, opportunities, bodies, and mental and physical health -- have historically been marginalized or minimized in research contexts. Most researchers today do not set out with a goal of sidelining women and girls, yet this remains a widespread phenomenon today, for both structural and attitudinal reasons. Researchers must challenge themselves to identify and mitigate biases on individual, organizational, and structural levels

Your role as a designer is to ensure you are designing for all potential users. It is important to check your understanding of who your users are, respect their experiences and wishes, and resist prioritizing some users' needs or responses over others.
