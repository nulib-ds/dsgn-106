# Documenting Primary Design Research

<big>_Written by: Stacy Benjamin, Kaara Kallen, and Michele Zugnoni_</big>

After you've completed your research, you should document it thoroughly and as quickly as possible, as your memory may be altered if you wait too long. You should also document the implications for the next stage in your design process in a primary research summary. In this way, you create a framework for justifying the elements of your prototype. As you've learned, it isn't enough to create a prototype; you must also explain why or take note about the justifications for each element of the design. By doing so, you not only provide reasoning about why your ideas are sound; you also enable others to replicate and build upon your ideas.

The research you conduct builds upon your knowledge of the design challenge, problems users face, and unmet needs they have. This may include surveys, observations, and interviews, among other forms of primary research. Some of this research might happen in person (e.g. with clients, users, family members, friends, or roommates you are currently living with) and some will happen remotely.

As you research, you'll want to gain answers to the following questions to be included in the documentation:

- What are you planning to do for primary research in the initial information-gathering phase? Start with an overview (e.g. Our primary discovery research will include a questionnaire, in- person observation, and remote short interviews.). Then go into specifics (e.g. The questionnaire will be distributed as a Google Form to 18- to 22-year-old college students on the Facebook groups \[name the groups\], and will include the following questions). Justify these plans.

- Who are your users or research subjects for each piece of this research? Justify your choice of users/research participants.

- How will you gain consent from your users to use their data? Will you be recording any interviews? Will you be collecting identifying information with surveys? Justify your choices here too.

- Is there any specific guidance you would like from your professors and other design teams in the class as you prepare for this research? What questions, concerns, or uncertainties do you have about this research?

Once you have this information, you'll want to categorize your information. For example, if some of your information focuses on the user's difficulty with writing, that can go under a category titled DIFFICULTY WITH WRITING. Under this category, you might include observations that you made about why and when the user faces difficulty with writing; interview answers which detail why a patient with carpal tunnel might have difficulty with writing, etc.

Once you have your information grouped by category, be sure to summarize the results in each category. This will provide your team with a brief overview of your results, which they can draw from as they develop the prototype and write the report. Your summaries should be methodical and thorough.

After you've summarized the results of each category, you'll need to incorporate those results into a testing report. Using the framework of a formal testing report can be extremely helpful. The components of a formal report are the introduction, methodology, results, and discussion.

**Introduction**. Purpose for doing the research. What are you trying to learn, and what is the context for wanting to learn it?

**Methodology**. How are you doing the research? The methodology includes your research tools (e.g., naturalistic observation; in-person interview; survey distributed via Google Docs) user or user group(s) (e.g., a middle-aged man with carpal tunnel syndrome; a sample of 100 college students recruited from specific Facebook groups), materials, and the time and date/date range you did the research.

**Results**. What did you learn? The results section includes only the raw data you collected. You are not doing analysis or pulling out implications yet. This is where you'll include the summaries you created for each category.

**Discussion**. The discussion is your analysis and conclusions, and also includes any limitations present during the testing.

If you are using more than one research method in the same session, make sure you detail each, and make clear which results belong to which method. For example, you might visit someone who has carpal tunnel and observe them using their home office space; while there, you might ask them questions and take measurements related to their desk set-up. Make sure, in your notes and your summary, that you identify what was learned through observation, what was learned through interview/conversation, and what was learned through measurement.

If you are doing multiple distinct research sessions (for example you survey people with carpal tunnel syndrome, and you also do an expert interview with an occupational therapist), it might be clearer to write a separate methodology and results section for each. You might have separate discussion sections for each methodology, or you might write one synthesizing discussion that pulls out important points, patterns, and implications from the research as a body.

Visual communication is an essential component of your primary research results. In your results section, include plenty of photos and/or sketches to help your reader understand, and you remember, what you observed. Generate surveys and tables to illuminate your survey results. In your discussion section, include a primary research table that pulls out key takeaways, their implications, and potential next steps in the context of your design process. Make sure to properly label your figures and tables, and to reference them in the text so the reader knows when and why to look at them.
