> In science, the credit goes to the [person] that convinces the world, not to whom the idea first occurs.<br>
> -- _Francis Darwin (son of Charles Darwin)_[^1]

As Francis Darwin points out, no matter how spectacular your ideas and designs are, if you can't communicate them effectively to a wide variety of audiences, they will not be recognized.

Effective communication is the vehicle to get your work documented, legitimized, recognized, utilized.

When you hear the term _technical communication_, what comes to mind? Perhaps you think of scientific reports, specifications, instructions, software documentation, proposals, or technical manuals. Perhaps you think of writing done by engineers to document a design project. Yes, all of this. However, technical communication is more than that. Technical communication includes writing produced in day-to-day business operations such as emails, memos, meeting minutes, and a variety of reports. These day-to-day communications can be described as _business communication_ or _professional communication._ And because oral and visual presentations are such an important part of professional life, technical communication also encompasses these as well. Websites and blogs are technical communication and increasingly, social media has also been included.

Specifically, technical and professional communication (TPC) involves communicating complex information to a specific audience who will use it to accomplish some goal or task. TPC provides specific information for practical and specific purposes (informing, instructing, persuading).

Engineers, especially, must be able to communicate within their teams and also be able to communicate complex information to a variety of audiences with different knowledge backgrounds. As Stephen Pinker explains,

The curse of knowledge is the single best explanation of why good people write bad prose. It simply doesn't occur to the writer that her readers don't know what she knows---that they haven't mastered the argot of her guild, can't divine the missing steps that seem too obvious to mention, have no way to visualize a scene that to her is as clear as day. And so the writer doesn't bother to explain the jargon, or spell out the logic, or supply the necessary detail.[^2]

Essentially, anyone who has developed a specific area of expertise needs to be mindful that not everyone around them knows the same information or even sees the world in the same way.

Thus, TPC is a highly designed form of communication that requires authors to have a heightened awareness of the conventions (rules and expectations) and rhetorical situations (audience, purpose, context) in which they are communicating.

## Why should you care?

Good communication skills, particularly in writing, are essential if you are going to succeed in the workplace. The working world depends on written communication because within today's organizations, almost every action is documented in writing.

In a recent presentation on the topic of Co-op Work Term Reports,[^3] the Engineering co-op coordinator for the University of Victoria presented the following statistics regarding the importance of communication skills in the professional world of engineering:

> ### The Reality: Technical Writing and Communication
>
> How graduate engineers spend their time:
>
> - 25-50%: Problem solving of some kind
> - 50-75%: Communicating (Writing and reading reports, letters, memos,
>   proposals, presentations, discussions w/colleagues, managers, clients)
>
> Performance evaluations and job advancement usually depend more on communication skills than on technical skills.

The engineering co-op coordinator added that engineers who are more advanced in their careers spend only 5-10% of their time engaged in problem solving of some kind and 90-95% of their time engaging in related communications tasks: researching, writing and reading reports, proposals, emails, letters, memos; giving or attending presentations; discussing and meeting with colleagues, team mates, managers, clients, and so forth. In a recent survey of over 1,000 professionals from various professions, over 70% of engineers and almost 50% of programmers rated the quality of their writing as either "very important" or "extremely important" to the performance of their jobs.[^4] It should be noted that while problem solving tasks and communication tasks are shown as separate activities, the reality is they are intertwined and work together.

The video [Writing in the Workplace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvAiE7owmeI&feature=youtu.be), shows interviews with individuals in STEM fields discussing the importance of communication skills in their fields.

## What is TPC's foundation?

Technical and professional communication is grounded in **Rhetoric,** the ancient art and science of persuasion. Unfortunately, in the 21st century, rhetoric tends to be positioned as something separate from everyday communication. However, all human activities are rhetorical, whether or not we are conscious of it.

Rhetoric is about the strategic choices and approaches we make to communication whether textually, verbally, aurally (heard), or visually. When we communicate with different types of audiences about the same topic, we make strategic decisions on what details to include or omit, what types of evidence or support to use, what medium to use, what visual elements to include, and what document design strategies to employ.

You make these strategic choices about which details to include or not include based on the particular **rhetorical situation** of your discussion. The rhetorical situation includes:

The **rhetor** (writer, author, speaker)

The **audience** including primary, secondary, and tertiary audiences The **topic** of the communication

The **purpose** of the communication

Note: The **context** and **culture** within which the communication is taking place impacts all elements of the rhetorical situation (rhetor, audience, topic, purpose).

Aristotle (ancient Greek philosopher) identified three rhetorical appeals: **ethos**, **pathos**, and **logos**. These three appeals are guided by **kairos**, which is about timing. The three appeals may be used alone, but arguments are most effective when the appeals are combined and have a strong grounding in kairos or timeliness.

**Ethos** (Greek for character): Ethos is an appeal to character, especially authority and expertise. Ethos is often mistaken as an appeal to ethics. Though ethics are an aspect of a person's or organization's ethos, ethics are not the only component of character, authority, or expertise.

**Pathos:** Appeals to pathos generally means appeals to emotions, both positive and negative. A rhetor may appeal to emotions that an audience already has about a subject, or a rhetor may elicit emotions.

As Aristotle argues, emotions are central to our decision making, though we may not be aware of this. If a rhetor desires to persuade a particular audience, then the rhetor must understand the ruling emotions regarding the topic and the specific audience. What makes the audience angry (or pleased), who or what is involved in producing or evoking that emotional state, and why does that particular audience become angry (or pleased) within a specific context?

Knowing the answers to these questions will help a rhetor better prepare an argument and provide a basis for developing evidence and identifying counterarguments.

Pathos appeals can sometimes be overwhelming and dominate an argument because emotions in general can be overwhelming. When emotions are strong enough, they can overtake logic and reason. Political campaigns are excellent examples of pathos appeals. Political ads often play on the fears and hopes of different demographics. These types of ads do not need to contain facts or evidence of such actions to be successful because they rely on the fears and worries that the intended audience already hold. Aristotle urges us to use pathos ethically. **Logos:** Logos is an appeal to logical reason. Logos is about the clarity, consistency, and soundness of an argument, from the premise and structure to the evidence and support. A rhetor appeals to logos by making reasonable claims and supporting those claims with evidence, such as statistics, other data, and facts. What an audience considers reasonable claims and adequate evidence is influenced by an audience's values and beliefs. Further, data and facts may evolve over time as we obtain more evidence, information, and data.

**Kairos** (Greek for time): In Greek mythology, Kairos (the youngest son of Zeus) was the god of opportunities. In rhetoric, kairos refers to the opportune moment, or appropriateness, for persuading a particular audience about a particular subject. Kairos depends on a strong awareness of the rhetorical situation\--it is the where, why, and when of persuasion.

Rhetoric teaches us that our communications must be shaped by an understanding of our intended audience and desired purpose. This is also true of technical and professional communication. The goal of technical communications is to get information from Point A (the author/speaker) to Point B (the audience) as efficiently and effectively as possible. A strong rhetorical foundation helps facilitate that transmission. Whether you are writing an email to a client, typing a memo for your boss, or preparing a presentation, considering audience, purpose, and context as you draft will help you be an effective communicator and increase your professional ethos.

## Possible Exercises

1.  Write a paragraph or two on a topic about which you have specialized knowledge, and can use specialized terminology to explain the idea or instruct the reader. For example, you might write about effective techniques for executing certain skateboard maneuvers or how to execute a yoga position such as a "downward facing dog." Consider your audience when choosing how to write this. Will the audience have to be familiar with the terminology used? See if you can baffle the audience with your techno-jargon and then re-write for a general audience, using plain language.

2.  Visit the website of a car manufacturer. Identify the use of ethos, pathos, and logos in both the text and the visual elements.
