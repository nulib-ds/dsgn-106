_Chapter 7 Introduction to Design Equity_ tells us that design thinking can be used as a tool for equity and social justice and provides the above schematic as a way to think about a design process that works toward equity and social justice. In this chapter we will think about how design and technical and professional communication work together to achieve, as best as possible, these goals. We will define social justice as "critical reflection and action that promotes agency for the marginalized and disempowered."[^1]

The design process we are learning is human-centered design (HCD). This process focuses on designing to meet the needs and desires of the users. Technical and professional communication (TPC) mirrors this goal, producing communication that focuses on the needs and desires of its users. They are also both concerned with the human experience and with the context---the rhetorical situation.

In a foundational TPC journal article, Carolyn Miller[^2] makes an argument for the humanistic value of technical writing. She says that technical writing is not neutral, as many people believe. Technical writing does not follow the positivistic windowpane theory of language, which holds that language can provide an unobstructed view of reality -- as if you are looking through a window. In fact, all design and all TPC take place within economic and political systems, and at a specific historical time. They are not neutral nor are they subjective. They are created using particular choices, and as such they demonstrate viewpoints and perspectives.

Human-centered design and TPC can provide an opportunity to advocate and create equitable design solutions. Buchanan observes,

> Human-centered design is fundamentally an affirmation of human dignity. It is an ongoing search for what can be done to support and strengthen the dignity of human beings as they act out their lives in varied social, economic, political, and cultural circumstances (page 37).[^3]

## Designing for persons with diverse abilities

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) over one billion people in the world (approximately 15% of the world population) live with a form of disability. Within this population, "...2-4% experience significant difficulties in functioning"[^4]. As with HCD and TPC, the context in which a person experiences the disability is important:

> In recent years, the understanding of disability has moved away from a physical or medical perspective to one that takes into account a person's physical, social and political context. Today, disability is understood to arise from the interaction between a person's health condition or impairment and the multitude of influencing factors in their environment. Great strides have been made to make the world more accessible for people living with disability; however, much more work is required to meet their needs.[^4]

There is terminology that reflects the two perspectives, one from a person's impairment and one from environmental factors. The term _people with disabilities_ signifies that the challenges faced by an individual are a result of the impairment. The term _disabled people_ signifies that the challenges faced are a result of the person's environment.[^5] The people-first term _people with disabilities_ is preferred. Regardless of the perspective, the goal of HCD is to enable the person with diverse ability overcome barriers.

Human-centered design, as practiced at Northwestern University's Segal Design Institute promotes social justice by empowering users with diverse abilities. The products the students design are intended to make the lives of these users easier, allowing them to better negotiate the physical context in which they live. The design process is human-centered by following the participatory approach shown in Figure 5.1. It starts with talking to users about the challenge they are trying to address. This allows the user to be the expert on the issue and honors that expertise. The user remains the focus as the design progresses, with the user providing input and participating in usability testing.

The supporting documentation for the design process, as well as correspondence with the user, can also work toward the user's agency. Care should be taken not reinforce the characterization of bodies as normal or deviant. Users must not be portrayed as damaged or lacking. Finally, there should be consideration on how the information is presented (e.g. visually, textually, aurally).
