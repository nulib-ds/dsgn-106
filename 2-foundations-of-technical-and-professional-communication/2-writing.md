Just as we use design processes to creatively solve complex problems, we use writing processes to create complex documents. In both cases, there are steps or stages, but we don't always proceed directly from one step to next in a linear manner. These processes are often iterative, meaning we might return to previous stages in the process from time to time. The more complex the task, the more iteration might be needed. Think about the design process as explained in the introductory video by IDEO and the Writing Process as depicted in [Figure 4.1](two-six). What similarities and differences can you see in these two processes?

You may have come across a "writing process" before, and it may or may not have worked well for you. There is no single process that works for everyone in every situation. The key is to recognize the various steps in a typical writing process and figure out how to use or adapt them most effectively for your situation.

Generally, we can think of the elements of the process in this way:

**Step 1: Planning**

- Conduct research
- Perform audience analysis
- Define document purpose
- Create task list (RAM Chart)
- Create timeline (Gant Chart)

**Step 2: Organizing and drafting**

- Chose the genre (e.g. report, memo, appendix)
- Write first draft

**Step 3: Improving style**

- Choose a style guide (for engineering courses it might be [IEEE style guide](https://www.bath.ac.uk/publications/library-guides-to-citing-referencing/attachments/ieee-style-guide.pdf))
- Attend to tone, spelling, punctuation, word choice, arrangement, design---all these are choices are rhetorical choices that work toward the effectiveness of the document

**Step 4: Revising, editing, and proofreading**

- Examine the document keeping in mind the subject, purpose, and audience
- Seek feedback from others e.g. peers, users, and subject matter experts (SMEs)
- Revise content and organization as needed
- Edit sentences, paragraphs, graphics and style choices.
- Proofread to eliminate spelling, grammar and typographical errors

These steps look like a rigid sequence, but writing is not linear. Writing is an iterative, or recursive process, going in and out of the steps. For example, you might draft a section, reread it, and correct some spelling errors. You have moved ahead to proofreading. Or, you might reread a section and determine that your argument is lacking, so you do some more research. You have now moved back to the first step. The circular representation shown in [Figure 4.1](two-six) is representative of the recursive nature of writing.

## Possible Exercise

The genre of a Progress Report often contains the following sections:

- Introduction

- Summary of completed activities

- Discussion of ongoing activities

- Projection of future activities

- Conclusion

Describe, generally, how you might apply the elements of the writing process to this genre.
