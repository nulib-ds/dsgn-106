The audience for a technical document---or any written document---is the intended or potential reader or readers. For most technical writers, this is the most important consideration in planning, writing, and reviewing a document. The writing should be adapted to meet the reader's needs, interests, and background. Lack of audience analysis and adaptation is one of main causes of problems in technical and professional documents.

One of the first things to do when you analyze an audience is to identify the _type_ of audience (or types---it's rarely just one type). Common audience categories for product design are:

**Experts:** These are the people who know the business or organization and their products and offerings very well. They have designed and tested their products. Often they have advanced degrees and work in academic settings or the research and development departments in industry or government.

**Technicians:** These are the people who build, operate, maintain, and repair the items that have been designed and theorized about by the experts.

**Executives:** These are the people who make business, economic, administrative, legal, and policy decisions about products designed and build by the experts and technicians. Executives are likely to have little technical knowledge. This will often be the primary audience.

**Non-specialists:** These readers have the least technical knowledge of all audience types. They want to use the products to accomplish their tasks or, the may just be curious about a specific technical matter and want to learn about it. Often, these readers will represent your secondary audience.

## Audience Analysis

Once you have identified the stakeholders, the types of audience who will read or listen to your communication, you need to conduct an audience analysis. This will enable you to create a user-centered and persuasive communication. It is necessary to understand your audience's level of understanding, their expectations, and their preferences.

Some key questions (Johnson-Sheehan, as cited in the [Purdue OWL](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/audience_analysis)) to ask about your readers are the "5 W's and H":

- Who are they?

- What do they need?

- Where will they be reading?

- When will they be reading?

- Why will they reading?

- How will they be reading?

The following reader analysis chart (Johnson-Sheehan, as cited in the [Purdue OWL](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/audience_analysis)) is effective to conduct an audience analysis:

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">

    <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Readers</th>
    <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Needs</th>
    <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Values</th>
    <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Attitudes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Gatekeeper</td>

## Audience Complications

There are several possible audience complications that you may encounter when creating technical and professional communication:

**More than one audience**: It is quite common to create a document for more than one audience. You can either write all the sections so that all the audiences of your document can understand them. Or you can write each section strictly for the audience that would be interested in it, then use headings and section introductions to alert your audience about where to find relevant information in your report. Or you could focus on the main decision makers.

**Wide variability in an audience**: You may realize that, although you have an audience that fits into only one category, their background varies widely. This is a difficult situation. If you write so that the readers with the least background can understand, the resulting document may be too long and tedious for many of the other readers. One solution is to write for the majority of readers. Another approach is to provide supplemental information in appendices or insert cross-references.

## Possible Exercise

Choose one of the topics below. Then perform an audience analysis using Table 3.1. Write a profile of your intended reader and consider what information they need and why.

1.  You have been asked to write a report on Maintaining Internet Privacy for

    a. A new internet user who just signed up for internet service

    b. A start-up ecommerce website developer

2.  Prepare a document on Food-born Diseases for

    a. Restaurant workers (servers and kitchen staff)

    b. For a health inspector training course
