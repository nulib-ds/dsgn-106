## Characteristics

Mike Markell,[^1] Sidney Dobrin,[^2] Elizabeth Tebeaux,[^3] Sam Dragga,[^3] and other technical communication scholars all identify similar characteristics of technical communication.

Technical and professional writing focuses on audience, is rhetorical, persuasive, purposeful, and problem-oriented, and is professional.

**Focused on audience:** Technical and workplace documents address a specific audience. The audience may be an individual or a group, and it may or may not be known to the writer. While a primary audience is always addressed, there may be a secondary, or even a tertiary audience. Thus, an understanding of the reader or user of a technical document is important. (More on audience in "3. Importance of Audience.")

**Rhetorical, persuasive, purposeful, and problem-oriented:** The focus of technical communication is to help the reader or user of a document solve a problem or compel others to act or do. The first two steps of technical writing are to identify the communication's purpose and audience(s).

**Professional:** Technical communication reflects the values, goals, and culture of the organization and as such, creates and maintains the public image of the organization.

**Design Centered:** Technical communication uses elements of document design such as visuals, graphics, typography, color, and spacing to make a document interesting, attractive, usable, and comprehensible. While some documents may be totally in print, many more use images such as charts, photographs, and illustrations to enhance readability and understanding and simplify complex information. Many communications can also be multi-modal.

**Research and Technology Oriented:** Because of workplace demands, technical and workplace writing is often created in collaboration with others through a network of experts and designers and depends on sound research practices to ensure that information provided is correct, accurate, and complete.

**Ethical:** Lastly, technical communication is ethical. All workplace writers have ethical obligations, many of which are closely linked to legal obligations that include liability laws, copyright laws, contract laws, and trademark laws.

Related, on October 13, 2010, President Obama signed into law the [Plain Writing Act of 2010](https://plainlanguage.gov/law/) (the Act) which is designed to promote clear government communication that the public can understand and use. The Act calls for writing that is clear, concise, and well-organized.

Another important consideration is to make sure electronic media, including e-learning documents, meet ADA (American Disabilities Act) laws for accessibility. More information is available on the [American with Disabilities Act website](https://www.ada.gov/).

Technical and Professional Communication (TPC) is often taught using a **genre**-based approach. As explained by Richardohnson-Sheehan,[^4] "Genres are patterns that reflect how communities, including people in technical workplaces, get things done. A genre shapes a project's content, organization, style, and design, as well as the medium in which it is delivered" (p. 2). Specific document-types can also be referred to as genres. Memos, proposals, progress reports are all genres -- and each of those have unique characteristics and rules (conventions).

TPC genres include (a) use of headings to organize information into coherent sections, (b) use of lists to present informationoncisely, (c) use of figures and tables to present data and information visually, and (d) use of visual design to enhance readability. Table 2.1 provides a summary of conventions of TPCs.

## Usability

Technical documentation is intended to communicate information to the people who need it, in a way that is clear and easy to read, at the right time to help make decisions, and to support productivity. Designing technical communication is like designing any other product for an intended user\--the ultimate goal is to make it "user friendly."

The late William Zinsser, author of _On Writing Well_, states, \"Good writing has an aliveness that keeps the reader reading from one paragraph to the next, and it\'s not a question of gimmick to personalize the author. It's a question of using the English language in a way that will achieve the greatest clarity and strength.\"[^5]

First, make sure your writing is **legible**. Is the font large enough to be read by a variety of audiences? Is it an easy to read font style that is appropriate for the content? If you are writing for electronic media, these considerations are especially significant.

Then, make sure your writing is **readable**. Readable means that your document can be easily understood by your target audience, and refers to the formula where by words, sentence length, and sentence complexity determine how hard or easy your sentences are to read. If your readability is too high for the audience, then they will either take more time getting what they need from your writing, or it won't be of any use to them at all. If the readability is too low you may come across as condescending.

Without exception, grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure have to be **correct**. Even a single grammatical or spelling error can cause your reader to dismiss you as not professional, as not caring enough to edit carefully. Poor writing at this level reflects poorly on your organization as well.

Finally, your writing may be legible and readable, but how well can your audience comprehend, or understand it in the way you intended? To facilitate **comprehension**, use language and terminology familiar to the reader, and limit paragraphs to one main idea. Strive for brevity if your users will be reading on tablets or mobile devices. Use visuals such as charts or diagrams to present a lot of information in a graphic format.

## Possible Exercises

1.  Locate some examples of what you consider technical writing. These may include correspondence, journal articles, lab reports, web pages, or advertisements. In small groups with other classmates, discuss how the documents reflect the characteristics of technical writing. After your group has analyzed the document, present it to the entire class and explain how it meets the characteristics of a technical document.

2.  Locate an instruction manual for a product you may own. Analyze it against the characteristics listed in the chapter for good technical writing. Submit your analysis in a memo to your instructor.
