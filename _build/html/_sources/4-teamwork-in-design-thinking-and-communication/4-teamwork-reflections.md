> **Overview**
>
> These reflections were created for Design Thinking and Communication at Northwestern University. Each reflection has a suggested forum (i.e., quiz, discussion board), but they can be assigned on whichever forum the instructor feels best fits their course. These reflections are formed around Phil Daniel's stop-start-continue format (see e.g., DeLong, 2011).
>
> **Reflection Set One**
>
> **QUIZ:** Thinking back on the client interview and/or the initial team presentation, how did your team divide up tasks? Did this division foster equitable distribution of work? How or how not? What might you have done differently to ensure that each team member had an equitable role?

# DISCUSSION BOARD (divided by groups):

> [Step One.]{.underline} Now that you've had a chance to reflect on your team's distribution of roles, write and post a comment in which you discuss:

(a) In terms of diving roles up equitably, what do you hope your team stops doing?

(b) In terms of dividing roles up equitably, what do you hope your team starts doing?

(c) In terms of dividing roles up equitably, what do you hope your team continues doing?

> [Step Two.]{.underline} Read and respond to each comment posted by your team members.
>
> [Step Three.]{.underline} Together with your team, decide on at least one answer for each of the following questions. Post your response to this discussion board.

(a) What will your team [stop]{.underline} doing?

(b) What will your team [start]{.underline} doing?

(c) What will your team [continue]{.underline} doing?

> **INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION**: Over the last few days, you and your team have had a chance to reflect on and discuss your team's distribution of roles for the client interview
>
> and/or initial research presentation. Take a moment now to reflect and write a response of at least 200 words on the following: (a) What went well? (b) How comfortable are you with the decisions your team made on things you will stop, start and continue doing? (c) What additional things do you wish your team would stop, start and continue doing? (d) How might you present these additional things to your team to ensure they happen?

>
> Have each of your team members been receptive to ideas? How or how not?
